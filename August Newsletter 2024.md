-ˋˏ✄ **Simone Biles' Triumphant Return**
One of the standout stories was Simone Biles, who made a stunning comeback after withdrawing from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. In Paris, she secured three gold medals and one silver, leading the U.S. women's gymnastics team to victory. Her golds came in the all-around and vault events, while she earned silver in the floor exercise. This performance marked a significant chapter in her career, bringing her total Olympic medals to seven golds, two silvers, and two bronzes across three Games.

 Katie Ledecky continued to cement her legacy in swimming, adding four more medals to her collection, including her fourth consecutive gold in the 800m freestyle. This achievement places her alongside Michael Phelps in Olympic history. Meanwhile, Summer McIntosh of Canada emerged as a new star, winning three golds and one silver, making her the first Canadian to win three gold medals in a single Olympic Games.

・゜-: ✧ :- **Sprinting Sensations**
In athletics, Noah Lyles captured the spotlight with a sensational performance in the men's 100m final, and an impressive performance in the men's 200m final, securing bronze even with an illness.    Gabby Thomas played a crucial role in the U.S. women's 4x100m relay team, helping them defend their gold medal. The relay showcased a thrilling comeback, with Thomas handing off to  Sha'Carri Richardson, who sprinted to victory.

﹒✎゛𓂅 **Suring Spectacle**
Surfing made a significant impact at the Games, particularly during a memorable day at Teahupo'o in Tahiti. The men's competition featured massive waves, with Brazilian surfer Gabriel Medina earning a near-perfect score of 9.90 for his performance. The image of the surfer striking a pose after riding a wave at the Games quickly made internet stars out of him and the photographer who captured it.

꒰ ᐡ ´͈ ᐜ **Basketball Showdowns**
The basketball finals were a highlight of the Games, with the U.S. men's team defeating the host nation France 98-87. The women's final also saw the U.S. team triumph over France, showcasing intense competition and skill in both matches.

Skateboarding made its second appearance at the Olympics, and the competition was fierce. Nyjah Huston of the United States won gold in the men's street event, while Momiji Nishiya of Japan defended her title from Tokyo 2020 in the women's street competition. The sport's inclusion in the Olympics has helped to showcase its growing popularity and the incredible skill of its athletes.

᧔𓈒༷♪˚.᧓ **Equestrian Excellence**
Outstanding performances marked the equestrian events at the Paris Olympics.   Charlotte Dujardin of Great Britain made history by becoming the first rider to win individual gold medals in three consecutive Olympics, cementing her status as one of the greatest dressage riders of all time. The team competition was also thrilling, with Germany narrowly edging out the Netherlands for the gold medal.

₊˚୭ ॱ˖ **Closing Ceremony** 
The Games concluded with a star-studded closing ceremony at the Stade de France, signaling the transition to the next Summer Olympics, set to take place in Los Angeles in 2028. The ceremony began with a prelude at the Tuileries Garden and included remarks from IOC President Thomas Bach and French President Emmanuel Macron, followed by the traditional handover of the Olympic flag to Los Angeles, the host city for the 2028 Summer Olympics.

 `· .    **📓 Back to School Essentials**  𓏴    ◞


🏫: Hey, Teethyz community! Now that leaves are beginning to fall and school is catching up to summer pretty quickly, it’s time to prepare for school! Luckily, we’re definitely prepared! Our newsletter team has picked a few school supply essentials. From backpacks to brush pens, we’ve got you covered!

𓂃 　౨ 𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟　　♡⠀ 　𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟 ৎ　𓂃

✦: ୨୧ *Back to School Essentials* 𓎠𓎠

🎒#1 - Backpacks: The most important thing is to have a cute backpack. Personally, I'd get a Nike or Lululemon one. Right now, I have a Nike backpack in black, and I'm so happy with my choice.

💧 #2 - Water Bottles: Next, a good water bottle. For example, Owala. They have lots of colors to choose from and are pretty good quality. Stanley or Lululemon have really pretty water bottles too. I can't even say which one I would pick, haha!

🥪 #2 - Lunchboxes: Another important thing is a snack box or a lunch box. I have reallyyy random boxes, so I can't really recommend any.

🎉 #3 - Extras: Some extra things that I carry with myself are gum, hair ties, a mini makeup bag, and a mini hair brush. Then, of course, my keys, wallet, and my phone. I try not to carry much with me. 

💻 #4 - Devices: If you have a school laptop or a tablet, bring that too. I don't have anything like that as our teachers always bring them to classes!

📒 #5 - Notebooks: Almost forgot to mention, buy new notebooks! If you have cutesy notebooks, it will motivate you, and your notes will look better too!
