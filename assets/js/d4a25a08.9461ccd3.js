I recommend playing for around 2\u20133 hours and shifting multiple times during those hours! Secondly, this is one of the best pieces of advice I've gotten. Which is focusing on your appointments. Trust me, you have nothing else to do but to make/do your appointments, so focus on them! Also, Be sure to interact with your clients and make them happy! Thirdly, I know using grammar is not a rule anymore, but I still would recommend using it since I think it's professional.
