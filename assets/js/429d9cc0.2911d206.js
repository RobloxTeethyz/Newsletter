Let\u2019s dive into the basics. Halloween started as a tradition long ago as the ancient Celtic festival of Samhein, a religious ceremony to conclude summer and welcome fall. Many would dress up and light up the night with bonfires and torches to scare away ghosts and evil spirits. Beginning in the eighth century, Pope Gregory III made November 1st a day to remember saints. There was soon All Saints Day, and the night before called All Hallows Eve, which eventually turned into the holiday we know and love today, Halloween! It\u2019s crazy to believe Halloween began as a celebration of the dead, however, the shoe does seem to fit!"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"\u2939  : How did Halloween traditions begin?\nHalloween traditions began with the Celtic festival of Samhain, marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter \u2014 a time when the Celts believed the boundary between the living and the dead was thin. On October 31, they lit large bonfires and wore costumes, often of animal skins, to ward off spirits they believed roamed the earth that night."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"In the 8th century, as Christianity spread, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as All Saints' Day, blending some of Samhain\u2019s traditions with this new holiday.
