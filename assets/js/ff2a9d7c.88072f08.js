Now coming from me, I know that you can do it, one quote I have always stuck to my whole life is "If someone else can do it, then so can I" which motivates me to go for it, and motivated me to keep driving to get MR and it worked. If you are truly dedicated and committed to reaching something or getting something, then I\'m more than certain that you have what it takes to get that goal, and I will always believe in you guys to one day make it to where I am now, and I hope that in the future I see some of you awesome people in my position and enjoy it as much as I do.')),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Q3: Do you have any goals for your future journey as a MR?"),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"A3: My only goal is to make sure that people have fun here.
