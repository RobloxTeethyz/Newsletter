Clearly, she can go into the future because I'd love to know how she knew that. Anyway, Leah said \"Someone cheated in Red Light, Green Light, and asked everyone if she could call them out.\" Now, I said yes and uhm, I was brought to Leah. Now, at first I genuinely thought it was a mistake because I had shiftlock on and I was facing another Supervisor. So, I looked at leah and said Uhm... Anyways, she said I cheated and said \"As a New Supervisor, you shouldn't be doing that\" etc etc. I can't fully remember what she said because I was in shock. But, thats when the tears started. I full on cried. OF JOY!!! and then my laptop nearly crashed from how many people was jumping around me and then the like 2 million pings started coming through.
