Ello everyone! Welcome to our August 2023 Newsletter aka our first published newsletter of the team's revival. For those who might be confused about the "revival" part, allow me to explain. The Newsletter Team was established around 2020, until it was sadly discontinued in 2022. There was a lot of discussions and debates onto *when* it would return to see the light of day. Around a month ago, the current PR department was ready to give the Newsletter Team another shot and we started working HARD to make it work. Of course, we pulled it off! We are happy to announce it's return back to our community. We cannot wait for all of you to read our monthly newsletter again!
