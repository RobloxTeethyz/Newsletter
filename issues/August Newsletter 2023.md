Ello everyone! Welcome to our August 2023 Newsletter aka our first published newsletter of the team's revival. For those who might be confused about the "revival" part, allow me to explain. The Newsletter Team was established around 2020, until it was sadly discontinued in 2022. There was a lot of discussions and debates onto *when* it would return to see the light of day. Around a month ago, the current PR department was ready to give the Newsletter Team another shot and we started working HARD to make it work. Of course, we pulled it off! We are happy to announce it's return back to our community. We cannot wait for all of you to read our monthly newsletters again!

The much awaited release of v3 was the topic of conversation at the beginning of July. On July 1, many players rushed to the game to enjoy the final seconds of version 2 at this momentous occasion, marking a significant achievement for Teethyz. A large number of players took pictures, hung out, and waited for the game to update to version 3. When V3 finally released, many players explored the updated map with its new features, areas, and modifications.Many were in awe as they explored the new map with new systems, areas and overall changes.  One MR team member commented that she "loves how it's so summery," while another thinks it “it gives off such a positive vibe”! V3 was a significant subject that had been discussed often for months and was now finally available to Teeth'yz community members, and other players!
This exciting moment was a huge milestone for Teethyz as hundreds rushed into the game to soak up the last few moments of version 2. Version 3 has allowed our community to create a lot of memories so far, and we intend to create much more as we travel together in the future.
