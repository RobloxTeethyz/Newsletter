Ello everyone! Welcome to our August 2023 Newsletter aka our first published newsletter of the team's revival. For those who might be confused about the "revival" part, allow me to explain. The Newsletter Team was established around 2020, until it was sadly discontinued in 2022. There was a lot of discussions and debates onto *when* it would return to see the light of day. Around a month ago, the current PR department was ready to give the Newsletter Team another shot and we started working HARD to make it work. Of course, we pulled it off! We are happy to announce it's return back to our community. We cannot wait for all of you to read our monthly newsletters again!

The main talk in the beginning of July was over the long-awaited launch of v3! Hundreds of players joined the game on July 1st to take photos, gather around and wait for the game to update to version 3. Many were in awe as they explored the new map with new systems, areas and changes. One member of the MR team mentioned how she “loves how it’s so summery” while another thinks it “it gives off such a positive vibe”! V3 was an important topic that was frequently discussed for months and was finally being released to the public. This exciting moment was a huge milestone for Teethyz as hundreds rushed into the game to soak up the last few moments of version 2. Our community has made many memories so far in version 3; we hope to make many more in the future as we continue to grow together.
