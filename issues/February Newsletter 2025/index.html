We hope you’re enjoying this month’s newsletter so far! This section will be all about awareness from the month of February and will hopefully give you some new necessary knowledge for <strong>Black History Month, National Cancer Prevention Month, Random Acts of Kindness Week, and Children’s Dental Health Month.</strong> Have fun reading! :)</p><p>First of all, February is black history month for the United States! During this month, we can observe the contributions and achievements that those of African heritage have made for our communities.</p><p>In many parts of the world, specifically North America, Black people have been put at a disadvantage due to their skin color. Although we now have laws in the U.S protecting People of Color, racism continues to be an underlying issue within our society. We should all be looking for solutions and ways to prevent this from occurring, and make sure to speak up when we can.</p><p>In 1926, Association for the Study of Negro Life and History co-founded by historian Carter G. Woodson titled the second week of February “Negro History Week” in the United States to acknowledge the achievements that those of African heritage have made. Then, in 1976, former U.S. president Gerald Ford realized how neglected POC were, and declared February Black History Month, which we still observe to this day.</p><p>During this month, be sure to support black creators and artists. You can do this by ordering food from a black-owned restaurant, following a social media account run by someone of African heritage, or donating to foundations such as the NAACP which help fund “political, educational, social, and economic equality for Black people in the United States” (NAACP).</p><p>February is also National Cancer Prevention Month! This month is to educate us on how to prevent certain cancers, as well as donating to funds that support those in need.
During Cancer Prevention Month, we can also take time out of our days to think of those who are battling these diseases and do what we can to help them continue with their journeys. Charities you can support are St. Jude’s, Cure Childhood Cancer, American Cancer Society, among many others. You can find foundations closer to you with a quick look-up on Google! ᥫ᭡</p><p>We also have Random Acts of Kindness Week! This week lasts from the 9th-15th of February, and is a week where we can reflect on our outlook on life and deeds that we do for the people that surround us. This week was created by the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, and their website has many ways to show people that you appreciate them.</p><p>Ways you can show appreciation can be as simple as saying thank you, especially to the people who don’t hear it as often. You can tell someone you love them, write someone a card, or even smile at someone. This is not limited to people you know, you can also do something for a stranger you pass by on the streets! Something as simple as complimenting a person is so easy to do, but leaves a lasting impact. </p><p>Random Acts of Kindness Week is a week to show love to others. What are examples of things you can do to show appreciation? Think of a plan, and feel free to ping @steveygamer2 or @carqlinees with your amazing ideas! ♥️</p><p>During February, the American Dental Association sponsors National Children’s Dental Health Month!

When I first read the notification I was basically screaming the house down. I spoke to my mom about LROTW before, so seeing that I got it really made me feel excited and recognized for the everything I felt I’ve put into the community.</p></li><li><p>A2: Advice I would give for other trying to achive LROTW would be; Don’t give up! Your time will definitely come. I would also say to continue working hard. Whether you play for 5 minutes or 2 hours, it doesn’t matter as long as you show up and work as hard as you can. Another thing would be to read the weekly goal and apply it into your hard work.</p></li><li><p>A3: A future goal I have would probably be to become an MR+ and train people or host at the training center. I was once there before trying to earn a rank and I learned so much from the trainers, so I’d love to share the experience to the trainees, and excitement with them when they pass. As for hosting the trainings, knowing I could host something that made someone one more rank closer to where I am today fills my heart with joy.</p></li><li><p>︶ ︶ ˏˋ ♡ ˎˊ˗ ︶ ︶</p></li></ul><p><em>Interviewer: stargvrlavie</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: iunatiqe</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: Honestly, I was so happy when I got LROTW lowkey I was getting spammed by my friends and was so confused until i went to staff announcements! It was such a great thing to achieve and I was incredibly proud of myself.</p></li><li><p>A2: Just try your hardest, I never thought that I would get it that week but I just kept persevering and it ended up successful!</p></li><li><p>A3: My future goal with/at Teethyz is probably just gain myself a good reputation and see where the road takes me, I would love to see how my journey continues with Teethyz in the future and as of right now I want to make a ton of friends and just have a good time.</p></li><li><p>︶ ︶ ˏˋ ♡ ˎˊ˗ ︶ ︶</p></li></ul><p><em>Interviewer: stargvrlavie</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: dorisxgchi</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: Well to begin with, I had no idea about it! I just got home home from school and I was so tired. Then I decided to open my laptop for some reason to check in on the server. Not to realise the amount of DM&#x27;s and Pings I got from so many people!!! I was quite shocked and suprised but at the same time quite happy.</p></li><li><p>A2: My advice is simple! Focus on enjoying the game and process. Don&#x27;t stress about the title, just put in the effort and be consistent. It&#x27;s important to stay motivated, but also take breaks when needed. Over working yourself can lead to burnouts, so just have fun and the achievements will follow!</p></li><li><p>A3: My goal in Teethyz is too keep improving and hopefully one day become an MR. I also want to continue contributing to the community and also help others grow and building strong teamwork. But most importantly, I hope to leave a positive impact and keep enjoying the game while reaching new milestones!</p></li><li><p>. ——— ࣪˖  ✿ ࣪  ˖ ——— .</p></li></ul><p><strong>🪽﹕ MROTM Interview ♡</strong></p><p>Q1: What was your reaction when you first got MROTM?</p><p>Q2: What advice would you give the LRs that are trying to achieve being an MR?</p><p>Q3: What are your future goals at Teethyz?</p><p>︶ ︶ ˏˋ ♡ ˎˊ˗ ︶ ︶</p><p><em>Interviewer: stargvrlavie</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: lvc1qa</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: My first reaction when I discovered that I was MROTM was incredibly surprised! I was simply messaging in the comms server, when I was pinged. I went along to LR Announcements and just wondered- why have I been pinged? And Lily (Stqrlls) congratulated myself and Chloe. I went to find out what happened, then I read the message and my jaw dropped. I couldn’t believe it, and I am still so so so grateful that I was chosen!</p></li><li><p>A2: My advice would be to stay confident and dedicated! Despite the difficulties and challenges that may face, always try your hardest for something that you wish to achieve! No matter how many times you may (for example) apply for TSA, or work extremely hard for MI and it simply doesn’t work- please don’t give up!! You have so many opportunities. Don’t let a small barrier like that prevent you from getting back up and trying again. As you may know, never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game!!!</p></li><li><p>A3: My future goals for Teethyz is to continue trying to spread positivity and kindness towards others, and even to help others do the same. I also would love to be a friendly helping hand that most can rely on (I am always here for you❤️) and to encourage those who may need it!! Another thing that I would like to achieve is to remain calm and determined, and to just continue to do what I am currently doing!! Finally, I am very grateful to be able to provide you all with trainings and fun shifts, and can’t wait to do so more!!</p></li><li><p>. ——— ࣪˖  ✿ ࣪  ˖ ——— .</p></li></ul><p><strong>🪽﹕ HROTM Interview ♡</strong></p><p>Q1: What was your reaction when you first got HROTM? </p><p>Q2: What advice would you give the HRs that are trying to achieve HROTM?</p><p>Q3: What has been the most rewarding experience during your Teethyz journey?</p><p>︶ ︶ ˏˋ ♡ ˎˊ˗ ︶ ︶</p><p><em>Interviewer: stargvrlavie</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: ii_axtumns</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: I woke up really early that morning and saw all the pings saying congratulations, i was super confused at first then I saw i had received HROTM! It was really uplifting and I was so surprised and still so grateful :))</p></li><li><p>A2: I would say the most important thing is to always do the best you are capable of, and stand your ground in what you believe is right. Never overwork yourself and never doubt yourself; trying the hardest you can at the time is all that matters in the end.</p></li><li><p>A3: Honestly my entire experience here has been so rewarding. When i first passed TSA in 2022 my goal was to reach the office manager rank, I would have never thought i’d be 2 years in and working alongside an amazing department. I’m so grateful for the opportunities i’ve been given during my time here, and i’m even more thankful about the fact that I can make a difference within the community for the better. It’s beyond rewarding knowing you have made an impact, and I plan to continue to do so :))</p></li><li><p>. ——— ࣪˖  ✿ ࣪  ˖ ——— .</p></li></ul><p><strong>🪽﹕ AOTM Interview ♡</strong></p><p>Q1: What’s it like to be working in Kohau’s Public relations department?</p><p>Q2: What’s is it like to be working with Teethyz as an alliance?</p><p>Q3: What is your favourite memory during your time in Public relations?</p><p>︶ ︶ ˏˋ ♡ ˎˊ˗ ︶ ︶</p><p><em>Interviewer: stargvrlavie</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: camzoole</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: Working in Kohau&#x27;s Public Relations Department is amazing, not only is it rewarding - but to me it allows me to work with likeminded individuals who truly care about the enjoyment of Executives. We&#x27;re all very clearly a team, and I love every PR member, each one bringing something unique to the team, whether that&#x27;s a talent or a special quality; none of us are the same truly!</p></li><li><p>A2: Before I was in Public Relations, I would always attend alliance visits to Teethyz - the main thing I&#x27;d pick up is how welcoming their team are, I&#x27;d always show up, greet them, and every single time despite the number of present staff members; they&#x27;d alert more of Kohau&#x27;s visit, which felt like a genuine thing to do. When I entered the Public Relations Department, this feeling only grew further as I saw myself and other Public Relations Members interact with Teethyz directly!</p></li><li><p>A3: My favourite memory of my time in the Public Relations Department is actually very recent! A couple days ago, my close friend amuhlia and I were up late to roughly 2 AM I&#x27;d say - planning for our Valentine&#x27;s Gala. We were in a private game, preparing for a &#x27;bit&#x27; to add a bit of comedy to the set, it was so hilarious and we filmed a chunk of it to keep.</p></li></ul><p>. ——— ࣪˖  ✿ ࣪  ˖ ——— .</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_xNQZ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_rwCy"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_vNka thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_ViEm"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">                  ‿ ‿ ‿ ‿ ‿ ‿ ‿ ‿ ‿ </span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_s1c6"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_J45_" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_zYXV"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_Ylf7"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>╰ <em>Section written by: stargvrlavie</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20e1aa4c-2856-486f-be00-4abc75cc1553" alt="February Promotions 2025" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p>Hey Teethyz community,</p><p>This month, Grace and I had an awesome opportunity to interview a few of our MRs who got promoted. It was a great experience, and we can&#x27;t wait to share their reaction with you! </p><p>Question: What was your reaction when you got promoted? </p><p><em>࿔:･ lvc1qa:</em></p><ul><li>When I was promoted I was extremely shocked!! I entered the staff chat, and found Louise doing some form of minion themed guessing game, and ofcourse I could tell it was a promo! But I didnt at all expect it to be me!! I was so surprised in the moment and was very grateful (and I still am!)! So many amazing people congratulated me with kind messages, and it was such a thrilling surprise. 🙂</li></ul><p><em>°❀⋆:･ jqycden:</em> </p><ul><li>I was so shocked since I was asleep and I woke up later then usually so I saw it a bit later, I was super happy though and I did not expect it at all!</li></ul><p><em>❀⋆.ೃ࿔:･ hwarmonize:</em> </p><ul><li>SO i was like on vc during the promotion and because it was very sudden i was so shocked &amp; i literally had no words for it</li></ul><p><em>࿔:･ plqsticz:</em> </p><ul><li>I was beyond shocked to be promoted to Supervisor! I always try my best to fulfil my position as much as I can and I cannot wait to take on this new challenge. I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect Promotion- from such a wonderful person as jayden!</li></ul><p><em>°❀⋆:･ ii_qlowingharper:</em></p><ul><li>I was so shocked. I really was not sure if I was going to pass but I DID!! I had over 400 notifications and they were all so sweet!  I was just getting home and I saw, I was so happy!!!!</li></ul><p><em>❀⋆.ೃ࿔:･ luvscc4rlaa:</em> </p><ul><li>When I saw that I was promoted to supervisor I was very surprised and happy. I was surprised because I didn’t know I would make it this far in my Teethyz journey. I was very thankful with all the people who said congratulations to me as well with this promotion.❤️</li></ul><p><em>࿔</em>:･ swanIcke:* </p><ul><li>I was genuinely so shocked and surprised, because it all happened so quick and unexpectedly! But I was proud of myself and so thankful for the promotion. I knew I had to host my first shift sooner! 😄</li></ul><p><em>°❀⋆:･ stcrlightts:</em></p><ul><li>I was so so confused why I was receiving so many pings at Teethyz, I was not expecting this at all. When I saw that I got promoted I was indeed so happy and proud of myself. This was a truly special achievement I made at Teethyz.</li></ul><p><em>❀⋆.ೃ࿔:･ flvawlessx:</em> </p><ul><li>I was so shocked I started crying, I was so excited!</li></ul><p><em>࿔:･ stqrllsfan:</em></p><ul><li>When I got promoted I was on voice chat and in game and I wasn’t really on discord but Kennedy out of the blue pinged me and said something along the lines of “I stalk my friends on life 360” so I replied “I stalk my brother there” and went back to game.. She then said something along the lines of “it’s weird how your not supervisor on there” at this point I was not in chat so I didn’t see until Richie started saying Jan go to chat. That’s when I went to look at chat and realised I was promoted! It was kinda shocking that I received it and I did scream in a lot of friends DMs, but a little message for anyone out there hard work does generally pay off.</li></ul><p><em>°❀⋆:･ zupreh:</em></p><ul><li>Jojo was telling me how it was a good day while we was shifting, and 2 hours after I had left the shift, she was in Staff Chat and she had created a word search for everyone to complete. There was 3 words we had to figure out and those was “New Assistant Manager”. Along the lines, Jojo said: “Well, Richie.. How is it being a new Assistant Manager?” and then the chat went crazy! I got many pings and DM’s and I’d like to thank Jojo for promoting me and supporting me through my journey as an MR at Teethyz.</li></ul><p><em>❀⋆.ೃ࿔:･ s9phzie:</em> </p><ul><li>When I got promoted to Supervisor I was literally so shocked. Basically, Louise was hosting some ‘guess the MR’ in staff chat and told us to ping people to come. After playing a few rounds she told us all to hype. At this time, we were all like ‘who’s it going to be!’, after some hyping she told as all to stop and announced my promotion in staff chat. I would’ve been jumping out of my chair but I was in English class and when I tell you I got weird looks, I got weird looks. Anyways, I’m beyond grateful for having the opportunity to be a Supervisor and host shifts. Thank you again Louise, I love you.</li></ul><p><em>࿔:･ bouuqets:</em> </p><ul><li>I was shocked. I had my airpods in since my phone got taken and all I could hear was the discord notification sound. I was so confused, this was around 10:41pm GMT and I was like what is happening. I woke up the next day bright and early at 9am, to see over 50 pings. I was SHOCKED. Genuinely I didn’t know it was real and I was extremely happy. I didn’t know that it would be happening because it felt so surreal. Jayden was telling me to stay up later, as it was the Valentine’s day shift and I completely regret not staying up as the promotion was in game. I was shaking and I’m so thankful for everything and could not thank Annie more enough for this promotion.</li></ul><p><em>°❀⋆:･ unicorngirlreeha:</em> </p><ul><li>I was surprised as I really didn&#x27;t expect it and especially during the Valentine&#x27;s shift also I was super happy because I got the chance to be promoted with some of my amazing friends and I&#x27;m so thankful to be promoted by annie!!</li></ul><p>╰ <em>Section written by: eviegracea and SiimplyBunnwy</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5b7473b-6f69-4fcc-bde2-1e9128ad2f3e" alt="February Birthdays 2025" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p>Hello, Teethyz!
