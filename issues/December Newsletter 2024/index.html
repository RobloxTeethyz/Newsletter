In this section, <strong>Isabella (flowersandrainbowzz)</strong> and <strong>Emma (lvnderhqze)</strong> interviewed a few people about their Christmas traditions. Now we want to hear from you! What are your Christmas traditions? Feel free to ping us in a chat if you&#x27;d like to share. Without further ado, let’s dive into the interviews!</p><p><em>•˙˚∘ Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: oceavnz</em></p><p>ʚ Question: How has your family&#x27;s way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: We started to stay home more, kinda just have fun and not really do much. Just play games and stuff.</li></ul><p>ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: Every Christmas we eat dinner and do some activities, and some family comes to see us.</li></ul><p><em>•˙˚∘ Interviewer: lvnderhqze</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: tomxqv</em></p><p>ʚ Question: How has your family&#x27;s way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: Well, we all used to go on vacation together but during and from COVID, we haven&#x27;t really been able to since.</li></ul><p>ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: We go to my dad&#x27;s sister&#x27;s house after Christmas dinner to celebrate with a party. We usually unintentionally sleep over until the next morning and it&#x27;s really fun since I&#x27;m with my cousins.</li></ul><p><em>•˙˚∘ Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: laufcyy</em></p><p>‌‌
ʚ Question: How has your family&#x27;s way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: I used to spend Christmas at my father&#x27;s apartment since he made really good food, and we didn&#x27;t want him to miss out on it, but that unfortunately stopped since he has been busy with work. Something that definitely changed is our family, since it has grown more, and we usually try to spend time with our friends too if it&#x27;s possible, which changes every year.</li></ul><p>ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: On Christmas Eve, we start with dinner, then snacks and a film. On Christmas, we decorate the Christmas tree more and usually go somewhere fun. When we come back, we make DIY ornaments as a gift to an anonymous person, which ends up with drama most of the time, but that makes it more fun in my opinion.</li></ul><p><em>•˙˚∘ Interviewer: lvnderhqze</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: lvauraas</em></p><p>ʚ Question: How has your family&#x27;s way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: It hasn’t really changed, we have developed some traditions which we’ve done annually since I was little, for example having a takeaway every Christmas Eve!</li></ul><p>ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: Every Christmas we do our traditions, then on actual Christmas Day, our family will come round and we will have a Christmas dinner and play board games and then the following day my family goes to my auntie and uncles house and we have sort of a second Christmas Day! It’s lots of fun!</li></ul><p><em>•˙˚∘ Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: vawerwii</em></p><p>ʚ Question: How has your family&#x27;s way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: My family used to watch Christmas lighting ceremonies, and now we do our own! We also have an aunt&#x27;s baking contest for the dessert in Christmas dinner each year, a tradition my dad&#x27;s side of the family has been partaking in since before I was born.</li></ul><p>ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: Every Christmas, we make chocolate chip cookies and peppermint bark for Santa. We also leave out carrots for the reindeer. After Christmas morning, we go over to my grandparents&#x27; house for dinner and host the dessert baking competition. We usually stay there for about 3 days with all of my cousins and it&#x27;s awesome!</li></ul><p><em>•˙˚∘ Interviewer: lvnderhqze</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: evwrmores</em></p><p>ʚ Question: How has your family&#x27;s way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: Our Christmases don’t change too much! Our family typically sticks to the same routine.</li></ul><p>ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?</p><ul><li>ʚ Answer: For us, Christmas starts on Christmas Eve. Every Christmas Eve, we go to my aunt&#x27;s house and all of the cousins get matching pjs. The next morning we open presents with our family (parents and sister) before everyone else comes over to our house! Christmas is always a big event for our family and a great way for us all to bond.</li></ul><p>This concludes the Christmas Tradition Interviews!

That’s what makes it such a fantastic winter break activity! ᝰ</li></ul><p><em>𐙚 Christmas Baking</em></p><ul><li>Another one of my favorite activities during the winter is baking! Baking is a fun activity where you make sweet treats at home! During Christmas, there are so many different holiday treats you can make to enjoy over the break! Some of my favorites treats to make are sugar cookies, and additionally I enjoy making/decorating gingerbread houses! Hopefully this winter you will be able to enjoy one of these activities! ᝰ</li></ul><p><em>𐙚 Build a Snowman</em></p><ul><li>A fun event that is perfect for the holidays and winter is building a snowman! You can use things that you have in your house to make a perfect snowman! When it is a snowy day, grab a carrot, something for the bottoms, and some clothes (like a scarf and a hat)! After that make three balls of snow all different sizes! Your biggest one the bottom and continue biggest to smallest! After that add your clothes and carrot! You now have a snowman! ᝰ</li></ul><p><em>𐙚 Snow Sports</em></p><ul><li>Snow sports like skating, skiing, snowboarding, and sledding are the perfect way to make the most of the winter season during your break. These activities offer a fun mix of adventure, exercise, and fresh air, all while embracing the beauty of the snowy outdoors. Whether you’re gliding across the ice, carving down a slope, or racing a sled with friends, snow sports create unforgettable memories and a great way to stay active during the holidays, as well as for many places it’s the only time of year you can! So best to take advantage of it while you still can, I know I will be! ᝰ</li></ul><p>⤷ We hope these ideas inspire you to make the most of your winter break! Whether you’re staying cozy indoors or heading out to embrace the winter wonderland, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Have a wonderful break! ♡</p><p>╰ <em>Section written by: nvoaas and cbvopppl</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e38b3d2-d781-4f10-aa3f-f0b8c0e927bf" alt="Christmas Word Search" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p>Hey everyone!

I wanna spread positivity and make people feel valued and cared for. 🤍</li></ul><p>—————————————————————</p><p><em>Interviewee: thiislqve</em></p><ul><li>Answer: My New Year’s resolutions would definitely be to take advantage of all opportunities given to me, as you only live once!! Another one of my resolutions for the New Year would be to maintain a better sleep schedule!</li></ul><p>—————————————————————</p><p><em>Interviewee: tacsi52</em></p><ul><li>Answer: I have a few resolutions I wanna do once the New Year comes. I want to get my productivity higher because I’m really not the most productive person ever, and yes I do get the urge to be so productive, but that lasts for like a day or two. I also want to get even more kind because I love being so and I think that everyone deserves someone to be kind to them! Last thing I wanna do is to fix my sleep schedule since it’s not the best, and I have to wake up early for school so I gotta fix that.</li></ul><p>—————————————————————</p><p><em>Interviewee: shallotatnight</em>

Tbh, I don&#x27;t think I will because my mum keeps buying sweets for my brothers and I love ice cream 😣, but I guess that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m a fattie!!</li></ul><p>—————————————————————</p><p><em>Interviewee: lukefromthedead</em></p><ul><li>Answer: Some of my New Year’s resolutions would have to be making more time for my mates, taking some time to chill, and finish my A-levels with some legendary results. 🔥</li></ul><p>—————————————————————</p><p><em>Interviewee: svntababy</em></p><ul><li>Answer: Hii!

I&#x27;m so glad to see you reading this month&#x27;s newsletter, especially this section! It&#x27;s always good to be mindful of the things that are happening in the world around us, so here is this month&#x27;s awareness section! I encourage you all to read this part and share this information with your friends and family! Getting the word out will spread lots more awareness. Without further ado, here is the awareness section for December, I hope you enjoy!</p><p><strong>⤹  : Christmas!</strong></p><p>Christmas is celebrated on December 25th, and marks the birth of Jesus Christ in the Christian religion. This date is very important to Christians worldwide, which is why it is such a famous holiday. Christmas symbolizes hope, generosity and brings the world together as a whole! It is observed with religious services like gift-giving, festive decorations (lights, Christmas trees) and great meals!</p><p><strong>⤹  : Hanukkah!</strong></p><p>Hanukkah, otherwise known as the &#x27;Festival of Lights&#x27; is an eight-day Jewish holiday commemorating the rededication of the second Jewish temple in Jerusalem! It honors the miracle in which a small bit of oil (enough for practically only a day) burned eight days straight in the temple&#x27;s menorah! This holiday can be observed by lighting a menorah each night, playing dreidel games and eating yummy food!</p><p><strong>⤹  : Kwanzaa!</strong></p><p>Kwanzaa is a week long celebration honoring African Heritage. It is centered around seven principles known as the Nguzo Saba which include unity, self-determination, and collective work. Traditions include lighting the kinara (candleholder), sharing stories, music, and a feast called the Karamu on December 31. Kwanzaa celebrates cultural pride, community, and shared values among people of African descent. </p><p>╰ <em>Section written by: fiinelines</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e38b3d2-d781-4f10-aa3f-f0b8c0e927bf" alt="December OTM/OTW 2024" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p>Hello Teethyz community! We hope you&#x27;re enjoying the newsletter so far. Here are our alliance and staff OTM interviews. I was given the chance to interview a Relations member from one of our alliances and our current staff of the month. Have fun reading!</p><p>・———— ・ ✿ ・———— ・</p><p><strong>♡ 🎄﹕ LROTW Interviews</strong></p><p>Q1: What was your reaction to getting LROTW?</p><p>Q2: What advice would you share to people who would like to become LROTW in the future?</p><p>Q3: Do you have any goals for your future Teethyz journey?</p><p>︶・︶・︶・︶</p><p><em>Interviewer: frnkoceean</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: bouuqets</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: I was so happy, I was extremely shocked as at first I didn’t think it was me.</p></li><li><p>A2: Always work hard and don’t try to “fit in” with others, but don’t overwork yourself. “You can do anything you believe you can do.”</p></li><li><p>A3: I hope to achieve higher roles and become like others. I hope to push myself to be the best that I can be.</p></li></ul><p>︶・︶・︶・︶</p><p><em>Interviewer: frnkoceean</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: Lilly_25200</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: I was honestly so shocked! I just woke up and saw so many notifications then realized I got LROTW and was filled with joy!</p></li><li><p>A2: Be as active as possible! Even 10 minutes in the game can make an impact and heighten your chances! A negative mind will not get you there, believe in yourself.</p></li><li><p>A3: My main goal is definitely to get MI (Management Intern) or pass TSA (Trial Staff Assistant) and become an MR but also to make people feel welcome into the community.</p></li></ul><p>︶・︶・︶・︶</p><p><em>Interviewer: frnkoceean</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: jcyIaa</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: I was so shocked. I got so scared when Lily pinged me. I was like “omg did I do something?” But honestly, I couldn&#x27;t be any happier and I&#x27;m so so so grateful for getting LROTW.</p></li><li><p>A2: Honestly, I don&#x27;t have any advice I could share, cause I didn’t expect to get LROTW! But if I have to share something, I&#x27;d probably say, be active on Discord. Chat with your friends etc. Being in-game is also advice I&#x27;d say! But, don&#x27;t overwork yourself! Fifteen minutes each day is ENOUGH!</p></li><li><p>A3: Yes, I do actually! I would love to try and make another comeback. I miss being an MR. I would also love to make new friends and a lot of memories!</p></li></ul><p>︶・︶・︶・︶</p><p><em>Interviewer: frnkoceean</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: NovaXPro160</em></p><ul><li><p>A1: I was so surprised. To be honest, I wasn’t expecting it.</p></li><li><p>A2: Be you! Don&#x27;t fret if you don’t win one week, you can always try another week. For example, I waited for 2 weeks, and I got it on the third one!</p></li><li><p>A3: Yes, I would like to reach beyond my boundaries, and discover many things that are yet to be discovered!</p></li></ul><p>・———— ・ ✿ ・———— ・</p><p><strong>♡ 🎄﹕ MROTM Interview</strong></p><p><em>Interviewer: frnkoceean</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: vcrsity</em></p><p>Q1: What was your reaction to receiving MROTM?</p><ul><li>A1: When I got MROTM my jaw instantly dropped, I had no thought that I would someday get it and when I did I was stunned. I was goofing around at McRonalds just trying to pass the time when my pings started to flood and direct messages were coming in red hot so obviously I got confused and went and checked it all out, and turns out I got MROTM!! Safe to say I was shaking and pretty stunned for the rest of the hour still in shock that I had even got it. I also had a smile that did not go away for the whole night, I was that happy.</li></ul><p>Q2: What advice would you share to LRs who would like to become MRs in the future?</p><ul><li>A2: Be unique, the key to standing out and being better than others is simply to be unique. If you think of it as an audition to become the lead singer for a band, they are going to be looking for a unique person with a fresh skill set who stands out from everyone else. Now coming from me, I know that you can do it, one quote I have always stuck to my whole life is &quot;If someone else can do it, then so can I&quot; which motivates me to go for it, and motivated me to keep driving to get MR and it worked. If you are truly dedicated and committed to reaching something or getting something, then I&#x27;m more than certain that you have what it takes to get that goal, and I will always believe in you guys to one day make it to where I am now, and I hope that in the future I see some of you awesome people in my position and enjoy it as much as I do.</li></ul><p>Q3: Do you have any goals for your future journey as a MR?</p><ul><li>A3: My only goal is to make sure that people have fun here. I wouldn&#x27;t ask for much else as the position that I am in now is what I need to make sure people enjoy their experience at Teethyz. This goal is already happening, however I want it to work on a larger scale. I want Teethyz to be a place where people can join to cheer up and have some fun and perhaps make some new friends, I love happiness and especially seeing other people happy is the best. I already do this with my shifts, by making them super interactable and fun for everyone no matter your rank. However now that I think of it, another goal would be to be a good role model for the community and help them to make their dreams come true, which I will try my best to do no matter what.</li></ul><p>・———— ・ ✿ ・———— ・</p><p><strong>♡ 🎄﹕ HROTM Interview</strong></p><p><em>Interviewer: frnkoceean</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: kkennedys</em></p><p>Q1: What was your reaction to receiving HROTM?</p><ul><li>A1: I was shocked. I didn&#x27;t expect it at all. I was very happy to see that I got it as well!</li></ul><p>Q2: What advice would you share to people who would like to become HROTM in the future?</p><ul><li>A2: The advice I would share with people is definitely to work your hardest and push your limits!</li></ul><p>Q3: What has been the best part of your Teethyz journey so far?</p><ul><li>A3: The best part of my Teethyz Journey so far has been becoming a part of the Recruitment team. The Recruitment team is such a fun and unique team and there is so much that comes from it. Everyone is so great at what they do and I have so much fun.</li></ul><p>・———— ・ ✿ ・———— ・</p><p><strong>♡ 🎄﹕ Alliance Interview — Pastriez</strong></p><p><em>Interviewer: frnkoceean</em></p><p><em>Interviewee: RblxPenguinn</em></p><p>Q1: What is it like to be working in Pastriez&#x27;s Public Relations Department?</p><ul><li>A1: Working in Pastriez&#x27;s Communications Department is very fascinating and engaging! You often work on a variety of tasks and ensure that events meet the highest standards. Creativity and engagement are key factors in everything we do when hosting events. We often collaborate with others and always make sure that our community and alliances are satisfied with the results! </li></ul><p>Q2: What is it like working with Teethyz as an alliance?</p><ul><li>A2: Teethyz is a great alliance to work with! We appreciate all the collaborative events we&#x27;ve hosted with them, and the community has been supportive. We&#x27;ve made so many memories together, and we can&#x27;t thank everyone enough for all the dedication put into these collaborative events. We also want to thank Teethyz for all their support, and we can&#x27;t wait to grow our partnership further with more fun events in the future. </li></ul><p>Q3: What is your favorite memory during your time in PR?</p><ul><li><p>A3: My favorite memory during my time in the Communications Department has to be the unique events! I enjoy seeing everyone engage in them and always working together as a team. I love seeing people support each other and make new friends along the way. It allows you to connect with others and creates a positive atmosphere when hosting these events.</p><p>︶︶︶︶︶</p></li></ul><p>╰ <em>Section written by: frnkoceean</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e38b3d2-d781-4f10-aa3f-f0b8c0e927bf" alt="December Promotions 2024" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p>╰ <em>Section written by: s7icy &amp; ribbvnns</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e38b3d2-d781-4f10-aa3f-f0b8c0e927bf" alt="December Birthdays 2024" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p>In December we have celebrated many MR+ birthday’s, below is how the celebrated their birthday! </p><p> <strong>J6V - 5th</strong></p><ul><li>Hi, I went out with my family to a nice restaurant!
