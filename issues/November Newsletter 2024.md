![Thanksgiving Traditions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/818ab82e-79d8-4ea4-835b-7662a0cfb96b)

In November, many families have their own traditions within their household. But, there are some that are used around the whole country. Some of these include…

1. *Having a large dinner*

 - This tradition of having a large dinner on Thanksgiving evening is an extremely common tradition. Many families make turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and other foods.

2. *Writing cards to people you’re thankful for*

 - Some people like to show their appreciation for other people in their lives by expressing it in a handwritten card. You can also buy a premade card from your local grocery store.

3. *Breaking the wishbone*

 - This may sound quite silly, but after carving the turkey, many families save the Y-shaped wishbone and later have two people break the wishbone in half for good luck.

4. *Macy’s Day Parade*

 - If you’re just looking for a relaxing Thanksgiving, you can watch the Macy’s Day Parade! Many families across the whole world watch the parade with their younger children or siblings. There are plenty of interesting performers, floats, and more!

5. *A Charlie’s Brown Thanksgiving*

 - Many people worldwide love to watch the classic Charlie Brown film. This is a perfect way to help people give a kickstart to their Thanksgiving.

![November Awareness 2024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fdee7c4-d6fa-48b1-ab38-babe3c63ccb8)


▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂

Hello Teethyz Community! During the month of November, there are a few several important events to acknowledge. Please take the time to respect and understand each of them. 

*Remembrance Day 🕊️*

Remembrance Day is held on the 11th of November, known as ‘’Remembrance Sunday’’. We recognize and remember the sacrifice of those who have fought for our freedom in World War I. Typically, a remembrance poppy is worn out of respect and gratitude for those who fought for their country in this war. The poppy is a symbol of peace and was seen growing on the battle fields. 

On Remembrance Sunday in Britain, there is a Remembrance Parade open to the public to recognize those who fought for and defended our freedom. The Remembrance Parade includes people who have served for the country such as royal family, soldiers, sailors, airmen, emergency services and cadets representing their service.

*Men’s Mental health Awareness 💚*

November is Mens Mental Health Awareness Month to acknowledge the importance of Mens Mental Health. The intention of this is to encourage men to communicate to others about their issues and to ask for support it they need it. Men are less likely to seek support than women, so it is important to raise awareness about support and to help people feel comfortable when talking about their mental health. This will improve the lives of those struggling with their mental health and encourage them to speak up. Never suffer in silence!

If you are struggling with your mental health, it is important to talk to a professional or someone you can trust. There are several helplines you are able to reach out to if needed. Help is always available and you are never alone.

*Guy Fawkes Day 🎆*

Guy Fawkes Day is an annual British celebration each year. This often contains fireworks and bonfires, In 1605 Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the British Parliament and eliminate King James of England inside. However, he was caught in the act and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. 

Because of this, King James of England made it an annual British celebration each year to celebrate the Parliament & himself being saved from the explosion. There is usually an event with fireworks across the UK with a bonfire as well. Many people across the UK include sparklers and fireworks in the festivities too! 🧨

.  𓏲 Greetings, Teethyz community! We’re excited to share our interviews with the November Management and Alliance of the Month, as well as the LRs of the Week. Check out their responses to our questions below; we hope you enjoy reading!
︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵

**. ੭  🧸  LROTW Interviews**

Q1: What was your reaction to getting LROTW?

Q2: What advice would you share to people who would like to become LROTW in the future?

Q3: Do you have any goals for your future Teethyz journey?

—————————————————————

Interviewer: 1stIovee

Interviewee: IoveIikes

- A1:   It was really early in the morning and I woke up for a shift but then saw that I got LROTW so I was very surprised but also excited! 

- A2: I think you should work hard and play to have fun instead of trying to chase LROTW! If the HRs notice your hard work they will give you LROTW no matter how hard youre chasing it!

- A3: I hope to become an MR in the future and help other OS achieve their future goals! 🥰

—————————————————————

Interviewer: svphiees

Interviewee: fashionistqs

- A1: I woke up on a school day and checked discord as usual,  ( I think this was at like 5am.. ) Teethyz was at the bottom of my server list so it took a while for me to get there but I did have 26 pings on there? When I saw I got LROTW my heart DROPPED. I was  so shocked and happy I started hugging my cat so much  and when I let her go she ran off she fell off my bed! ( She landed on her feet don’t worry. ) 😭

- A2: Don’t push yourself over the line. Make some notes on procedures with extra detail so you know what to type, including guides! These can help if you’re not in the mood to type all those words! 🫶🏽

- A3: My current goal is to reach MI! If I ever do reach that, doing my first training would be a milestone, especially hosting a shift! 

Thank you for reading! 
- Sav 🎀

—————————————————————

Interviewer: svphiees

Interviewee: aeuvna

- A1: Honestly, I was really surprised and didn’t expect it at all, but I’m incredibly grateful for receiving LROTW. I would like to thank all my friends who helped me achieve this as it wouldn’t have been possible without their constant support. They always encouraged me to keep going and pushed me to always try my best and never give up.

- A2: My advice would be to stay consistent and dedicated. Always try your best, be respectful, help others who need assistance, and create a positive environment overall. You might not notice it at first, but hard work always pays off. Remember that nothing is impossible to achieve because even the word "impossible" has "I’m possible" in it. Believe in yourself, because whatever you set your mind to, you can achieve it with effort and determination.

- A3: Yes, I have a few goals. Firstly, I would love to connect with more people in the community, getting to know everyone better and possible making new friendships along the way. Additionally, I aim to engage more and take on additional responsibilities as I continue growing throughout my Teethyz journey. Overall, I’m excited to keep learning, improving, making new friendships, and possibly contributing even more to the team in the future!

—————————————————————

Interviewer: svphiees

Interviewee: amicadiFYA

- A1: My reaction when I received the LROTW was happy and excited because it's like the first time I've received it and I honestly wasn't expecting it!

- A2: The advice I would give to people or my friends who want to become a LROTW would be to be positive, work every day max 30 minutes a day, make nice and decorative guides, be kind and try to join shifts!

- A3: Yes my goal that I would like to achieve in the future is to try to become a MR even if I failed the MI I want to try again one more time and I am sure that I will make it and my time will come one day!

**. ੭  🤍 MROTM Interview**

Interviewer: 1stIovee

Interviewee: fiinelines

Q1: What was your reaction to receiving MROTM?

- A1: I was at a choir festival and was very busy and overwhelmed with my real life stuff, so when I saw that I got MROTM, I was SOOO EXCITED! my heart was full of joy and accomplishment! 

Q2: What advice would you share to LRs who would like to become MRs in the future?

- A2: My advice would be to be consistently active within the discord channel and in game, but to not overwork yourself! 15-30 minutes a day in game is amazing and shows so much dedication! Also, make friends and memories!!! You’re only an LR  for so long, before you get that MR promo!!!

Q3: Do you have any goals for your future journey as a MR?

- A3: My #1 goal as an MR would probably be to end up as a Dental Board in the future!! I never would have thought it was possible if I didn’t get MROTM, or really any promotion but I am really looking forward to my future here at Teethyz!! 

Thank you so much for MROTM!! 💕💕💕

︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵

**. ੭  🍪 HROTM Interview**

Interviewer: 1stIovee

Interviewee: lvsvnnyy

Q1: What was your reaction to receiving HROTM?

- A1: I woke up at 6 am to see a bunch of pings and I check staff announcements to see that I got HRTOM! I was so happy, the adrenaline woke me up and I couldn’t fall back asleep for like an hour.

Q2: What advice would you share to people who would like to become HROTM in the future?

- A2: Pace yourself! Don’t feel pressured to do too much, just enjoy your time as an HR and make the best of it. If you’re enjoying what you’re doing and not burning yourself out, you can reach great heights!

Q3:  What has been the best part of your Teethyz journey so far?

- A3: It’s probably now! I’ve made so many great friends and I just feel so integrated into the community. There’s so many amazing people here and although there may be low points I’ve persevered and I couldn’t have made it this far without my friends.

︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵

**. ੭  🌸 AOTM Interview**

Interviewer: 1stIovee

Interviewee: aussence - Maki Representative

Q1: What is it like to be working in Maki’s Public Relations Department?

Q2: What advice would you share to people who would like to get into PR in the future?

- A2: I highly recommend focusing on one group first. This way, your focus won't shift and you are more likely to accomplish your goal.

Q3: What is it like working with Teethyz as an alliance?
