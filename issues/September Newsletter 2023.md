Greetings, Teethyz community! This month we asked a few MR+ about their favorite fall food and activities. Do you have any of the same interests as some of the people below? Keep reading to find out!


**Interviewee: e2milys**

• 1) What’s your favorite fall activity? 
My favorite fall activity has to definitely be going to an apple orchard! Not only is the aesthetic so cozy but the smell and vibes are just so addicting and entertaining to be around. The one near me has a hayride and pumpkin patch which is always fun as well! You really can't go wrong with apple orchards and they are such fall staples.

• 2) What’s your favorite fall food?
My favorite fall food is a hard question because they are all so delicious! My family always gets a lot of apple themed foods at the apple orchard and they last us a long time. If I had to choose though, I would choose an apple pie! They are definitely one of the best pie flavors and I haven't met someone who doesn't like it. You can get them practically everywhere and are soooo heavenly and addicting, you can't have just one slice!


**Interviewee: vcorria**

• 1) PUMPKIN PICKING
• 2) CARAMEL APPLES

**Interviewee: 1ndvie**

• 1) One of my favorite fall activities is apple picking. It brings back childhood memories, from sipping fresh apple juice, eating pumpkin pie, playing games with family and friends, and lastly picking out fresh apples! 

• 2) My mom's pumpkin muffins are definitely my favorite fall food. It brings memories of the season. As well,  Starbucks pumpkin chai latte is my all time favorite fall drink! It’s perfect for weather and the season.

**Interviewee: lookingforsxphie**

• 1) Well it's currently almost Summer for me, but in the Autumn I love to go leaf hunting! I actually have a scrapbook full of Autumn leaves from all years back until 2015!

• 2) I love a hot bowl of vegetable soup!


Thank you for reading and have a lovely September and a wonderful fall! We hope you enjoyed learning a little more about some of our MR+ members.

Greetings Teethyz! This story is something that **Jayla (jayIavs)** encountered at the dentist which seems quite humorous to me and maybe to you too. Do you have any of your own encounters at the dentist which has stuck with you? I definitely have a few. Now without further wait, have fun reading!

Jayla’s (jayIav) story: “This happened right after I resigned. I was shifting as an orthodontist when a Random Client came up to me saying things like "hi im stqrlls, this is my alt" i was so confused bc i couldn’t tell if they were lying or not 😭. i js answered with "oh ok." They kept following me and after 10-15 minutes they said “im promoting u to sa" i was like "UHM what! I’m an ortho, that’s not possible" and then they started yelling at me for not believing them 💀. i laughed so hard but the most funniest thing was that they "promoted" every single orthodontist and x-ray specialist to sa! it was so weird. i wasn’t able to report cause for some reason their username didn’t show up but oh well that was funny to me.”

Throughout this month, some significant memories have been made in the dentist and our training center. These photos capture friendship in its true glory; whether it be a shift picture or a training photo, memories were made in the process. You may even be in one of the photos! Take a look through some of our September snapshots below.

Greeting once again Teethyz, and welcome back to our Of The Month section! In this section you will find out about our Alliance of the month, our MR of the month, and our HR of the month! Let's start with our MR of the month!

Our MR Of The Month was… **eriqva (Erica)**!  We are all very proud of her for winning such a highly esteemed award! I was able to get an exclusive interview with Erica as a part of this, so read and enjoy!

Interviewer: Furnface
Interviewee: eriqva (Erica)

1.  Q(Furnface) What was your reaction to getting MR of the month?
     A(Erica) I woke up to being pinged a lot, I felt really proud of myself. I remember being really excited about my custom pink color.
2. Q(Furnface) What’s some advice you would give to LR’s trying to be an MR one day.
    A(Erica) If they are aiming to reach MR, I would tell them to focus on activity, communication, multiple skills that would be valuable for the MR team. Continuously learn and improve, stay determined and don’t give up if you fail at first. Lastly I would remind them that it is also just a game and you should always put yourself over it, but if it’s something you really do care about, go for it!
3. Q(Furnface) What’s some advice you would give to MR’s trying to one day get MR of the month.
    A(Erica) Set clear goals, define what you want to achieve and create a plan to achieve those goals, excel in your current rank, go above and beyond in your responsibilities. Deliver exceptional results, and constantly exceed expectations. Stay motivated, and maintain a growth mindset. I want to remind you that you don’t really need certain things to be chosen, I tried my best to be communicative and active.

Some great words from Erica and we congratulate her on the amazing achievements and getting MR of the month! Now for our HR of the month segment! Our HR for the month of September was… **stqrlls!

1. Q(Furnface) What was your reaction to getting HR of the month?
     A(Lily) I was very shocked! I was not expecting it at all.
2. Q(Furnface) What’s some advice you would give to LR’s trying to be an HR one day.
     A(Lily) Don’t be afraid to speak up and share your opinions!
3. Q(Furnface) What’s some advice you would give to MR’s or even HR’s trying to one day get MR or HR of the month.
     A(Lily) Do not give up, maintain good activity and communicate with others as much as you can. Don’t overwork yourself though!
