People from all throughout the country take part in festivities, festivals, and educational activities that discuss tradition and history during this holiday. Now is the moment to pay attention to and honor the distinctive traditions that have had a significant impact on American society.

Greetings, Teethyz community! This month we asked a few MR+ about their favorite fall food and activities. Do you have any of the same interests as some of the people below? Keep reading to find out!

• 1) What’s your favorite fall activity? 
My favorite fall activity has to definitely be going to an apple orchard! Not only is the aesthetic so cozy but the smell and vibes are just so addicting and entertaining to be around. The one near me has a hayride and pumpkin patch which is always fun as well! You really can't go wrong with apple orchards and they are such fall staples.

• 2) What’s your favorite fall food?
My favorite fall food is a hard question because they are all so delicious! My family always gets a lot of apple themed foods at the apple orchard and they last us a long time. If I had to choose though, I would choose an apple pie! They are definitely one of the best pie flavors and I haven't met someone who doesn't like it. You can get them practically everywhere and are soooo heavenly and addicting, you can't have just one slice!

• 1) One of my favorite fall activities is apple picking. It brings back childhood memories, from sipping fresh apple juice, eating pumpkin pie, playing games with family and friends, and lastly picking out fresh apples! 

• 2) My mom's pumpkin muffins are definitely my favorite fall food. It brings memories of the season. As well,  Starbucks pumpkin chai latte is my all time favorite fall drink! It’s perfect for weather and the season.

• 1) Well it's currently almost Summer for me, but in the Autumn I love to go leaf hunting! I actually have a scrapbook full of Autumn leaves from all years back until 2015!

• 2) I love a hot bowl of vegetable soup!


Thank you for reading and have a lovely September and a wonderful fall! We hope you enjoyed learning a little more about some of our MR+ members.
