I hope you are enjoying the newsletter, because we know we are. 17thwish and carolineinthemorning are proud to present our section of the newsletter, the history of Halloween, and how the traditions originated! Halloween is celebrated all over the world, and it is important to know where this tradition started, how it did and how people celebrate it today! Without further ado, here is the newsletter!</p><p><em>⤹  : How did Halloween originate?</em></p><p>Halloween is widely celebrated in many places around the world, but has it ever come to mind, how did Halloween come to begin? Let’s dive into the basics. Halloween started as a tradition long ago as the ancient Celtic festival of Samhein, a religious ceremony to conclude summer and welcome fall. Many would dress up and light up the night with bonfires and torches to scare away ghosts and evil spirits. Beginning in the eighth century, Pope Gregory III made November 1st a day to remember saints. There was soon All Saints Day, and the night before called All Hallows Eve, which eventually turned into the holiday we know and love today, Halloween! It’s crazy to believe Halloween began as a celebration of the dead, however, the shoe does seem to fit!</p><p><em>⤹  : How did Halloween traditions begin?</em></p><p>Halloween traditions began with the Celtic festival of Samhain, marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter — a time when the Celts believed the boundary between the living and the dead was thin. On October 31, they lit large bonfires and wore costumes, often of animal skins, to ward off spirits they believed roamed the earth that night.</p><p>In the 8th century, as Christianity spread, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as All Saints&#x27; Day, blending some of Samhain’s traditions with this new holiday. The night before became known as All Hallows’ Eve, later called Halloween.</p><p>When English settlers arrived in America, they brought some of these customs with them. Halloween took on new forms as diverse colonial cultures blended, with early celebrations called &quot;play parties&quot; held in the fall. People would dress up, tell fortunes, and share ghost stories. Over time, Halloween grew into the celebration we know today, filled with trick-or-treating, jack-o-lanterns, costumes, and festive gatherings.</p><p><strong>⤹  : Interviews!</strong></p><p>Now, we were interested in what other people thought about this topic, so we asked a couple of MRs their thoughts on the traditions! For ourselves, we both love dressing up for Halloween. We also love how we get to get a lot of candy and eat it all! Now, for some other peoples opinions!</p><p><em>︙・&gt; Question: What are your favorite Halloween traditions?</em></p><p>Interviewed: svphiees</p><p>Interviewer: 17thwish</p><p>Response: &quot;Carving cat faces in pumpkins, trick or treating with my friends, baking Halloween deserts, and I also host charity evens relating to Halloween too!&quot;</p><p>Interviewed: vcorria</p><p>Interviewer: carolineinthemorning</p><p>Response: &quot;Every year I do pumpkin picking and carve them! I also do trick or treat!&quot;</p><p>That wraps up our sections of the newsletter! I hope you enjoyed it, because we certainly enjoyed making it! If you are curious about any other part about this subject, feel free to ask us or go research it yourself! It is a very unique holiday, and it is celebrated by many across the world! We also hope you had a great month, happy Halloween!</p><p>— <em>Section written by: carolineinthemorning &amp; 17thwish</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f307abbd-180d-4313-8f34-5dc8b37aee19" alt="Halloween Costume" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p>ʚ ݁ ˖  Hii, Teethyzians!

Inflatable dinosaurs are a fun choice for kids, while fairytale characters and costumes inspired by current TV shows and movies, like &quot;Stranger Things,&quot; also capture attention.</p><p><em>ੈ✩‧₊˚ Question: What are you going to be for Halloween, and why?</em></p><p>༶•┈┈┈┈୨♡୧┈┈┈┈•༶</p><p>Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz
Interviewee: PerfectlyAnnie</p><p>For Salloween I’m going to be Brittany S. Pierce from Glee!

In this section, I will be writing about awareness featured in the month of <strong>October</strong>! I would be very glad to share with you all the things I wrote about. Why not sit back and relax..and maybe grab some popcorn?!</p><p><em>World Mental Health Day:</em></p><p>World Mental Health Day is observed on October 10 each year to raise awareness about mental health issues and promote mental well-being globally. It encourages discussions, reduces stigma, and highlights the importance of mental health care. Each year features a specific theme to address particular mental health challenges and advocate for better support and resources.</p><p><em>Diwali:</em></p><p>Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a major Hindu festival celebrated by millions around the world. It usually lasts five days and signifies the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. Key rituals include lighting oil lamps (diyas), decorating homes, exchanging gifts, and participating in prayers (pujas) dedicated to deities like Lakshmi and Ganesha. Diwali is also celebrated by other communities, including Jains and Sikhs, each with its cultural significance and traditions.</p><p><em>Breast Cancer Awareness Day:</em></p><p>Breast Cancer Awareness Day, often observed on October 13, is part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October. The day aims to raise awareness about breast cancer, educate the public on prevention and early detection, and support those affected by the disease. It encourages activities like awareness campaigns, fundraising for research, and sharing survivor stories to promote understanding and support for breast cancer patients.
‌‌
<em>Black Cat Day:</em></p><p>Black Cat Day, celebrated on October 27, is dedicated to raising awareness about the misconceptions and superstitions surrounding black cats. It promotes the idea that black cats are not unlucky but rather deserving of love and care, just like any other pet. The day encourages the adoption and appreciation of black cats, highlighting their unique beauty and companionship.</p><p>ʚ ݁ ˖  This is now the end of the awareness section!

Throughout October, several outstanding members of the community were awarded OTM/OTW titles for their hard work and dedication. We had the opportunity to interview some of them to hear their perspectives on their remarkable achievements.</p><p>•༶•┈┈┈┈┈┈.˚₊౨ৎ ₊˚. ┈┈┈┈┈┈•༶•</p><p><strong>MR and HR of the Month</strong></p><p>Interviewer: SiimplyBunnwy</p><p>Interviewee: flowersandrainbowzz</p><p><em>What was your initial reaction to seeing you receive mr of the month?</em></p><p>My initial reaction when I first received MR of the Month was confused. STORY TIME!! When I got home from school I opened my DMs first, and saw a bunch of people congratulating me, and my first thought was &quot;Oh! Did I get a position I applied for in another group?!&quot; but then I also thought, &quot;All the people congratulating me are from Teethyz though..&quot; BUT the last DM I opened said &quot;CONGRATS ON MROTM!!&quot; and I was SO confused. I then went into Staff Chat to congratulate the people who got promoted that day, but then I saw a badge next to my name! I scrolled down and saw that I had a role saying MR of the Month..I felt so excited of how I got noticed! All the MRs are so amazing, so it just made me feel so lucky to be the one standing out for September. AND UHM, I actually nearly fell off my chair... I would definitely say the excitement took over!!</p><p><em>What advice would you give to LR’s who are trying to become an MR in the future?</em></p><p>Some advice I would give to LRs who are trying to become an MR in the future would be to never give up on your dream of being on the Management Team! Your hard work will always pay off, you just need to believe in yourself! Everyone who is an MR+ here has been an LR like you, and we all had similar experiences! If you ever need someone to encourage you not to give up, I&#x27;m always here if you need me! As an LR I almost decided to give up, but then one amazing person told me not to, and I&#x27;m so glad they did. It&#x27;s all sooo worth it in the end. Being an LR has a lot of fun perks to it; you can attend Recruitment Shifts, you can earn Hardest Worker in shifts, you also have a chance of earning some recognition if you get LR of the Week! My advice would definitely be to never give up, and always follow your dreams. You got this! ❤️</p><p><em>How has your experience been at Teethyz Dentist so far?</em></p><p>My experience at Teethyz has been absolutely amazing so far!! The community here is so awesome, and I&#x27;m so excited to see what Teethyz will hold for us in the future. A special shoutout to the amazing LRs, MRs, HRs, SHRs, and developers of Teethyz that made this possible! All of you amazing Teethyzians are what makes the community so special and unique! Everyone here is super friendly and supportive. I have definitely made some special and unforgettable memories here. Teethyz is for sure one of the best communities I have even been in! As always, keep being you! You are all sooo wonderful and amazing and what makes Teethyz Dentist stand out. Love you all so much!</p><p>Interviewer: SiimplyBunnwy </p><p>Interviewee: vcorria</p><p><em>What was your initial reaction to seeing you receive HR of the month?</em></p><p>I was playing one of those line simulator games on Roblox when I started hearing all these pings go off on my phone. I was a bit shocked since I didn&#x27;t expect it!</p><p>*What advice would you give to LR’s who are trying to become MR in the future?</p><p>My personal advice would be don&#x27;t overwork yourself! Spending 30 minutes to one hour a day is more than enough. Attend shifts, recruitment shifts, and communicate in the discord from time to time. Prioritize maintaining consistent activity along with being involved within the community. Your hard work is always being recognized and is definitely appreciated! 🤍</p><p><em>How has your experience been at Teethyz Dentist so far?</em></p><p>I’ve been an MR since March 2023 and it&#x27;s been great so far!</p><p><strong>LR of the Week</strong></p><p>Interviewer: SiimplyBunnwy</p><p>Interviewee: starlqcies </p><p><em>What was your initial reaction upon seeing that you received the &quot;Low rank of the Week&quot; award?</em></p><p>I was very surprised but at the same time knew I deserved it because of my hard-work and dedication that I had done. I’ve been very respectful and responsible with my rank, and knew I could achieve LROW I’m very grateful and thankful for it as well!</p><p><em>What advice would you give to others aspringing to be LR of the week?</em></p><p>To always show dedication, hard-work, honesty, professionalism, and to show respect and responsibility with your rank. Always think positive don’t ever think other wise, the most important thing is to have fun and interact with others!</p><p><em>How has your experience been at Teethyz Dentist so far?</em></p><p>My experience at Teethyz Dentist has been phenomenal! I’ve met so many great people, and being able to interact with even more people and work has boosted my experience up above anything.</p><p>Interviewer: SiimplyBunnwy</p><p>Interviewee: iluvseoul</p><p><em>What was your initial reaction upon seeing that you received the &quot;Low rank of the Week&quot; award?</em></p><p>I was initially shocked as I was in-game and checked my Discord to 21 pings 😭. When I saw the announcement, I was very excited and shaking.</p><p><em>What advice would you give to others aspringing to be LR of the week?</em></p><p>Honestly, just be active. Join and participate in shifts, complete appointments, and try to meet new people. Keep it all balanced. 💗</p><p><em>How has your experience been at Teethyz Dentist so far?</em></p><p>It&#x27;s been really great. Earning points has been both easy and challenging. Sometimes it can be a little demotivating, but the people I&#x27;ve met here have already warmed my heart. They have been nothing but welcoming to me. I always look forward to shifts because I think they&#x27;re so fun!</p><p>Interviewer: alzssi</p><p>Interviewee: Limonaka_Youtube</p><p><em>What was your initial reaction upon seeing that you received the &quot;Low rank of the Week&quot; award?</em></p><p>When I got up in the morning... I took my phone in my hand and I see that I have a lot of notifications, which surprised me a lot. I opened Discord, entered the Teethyz communication server and saw that I was Low rank of the week! I was really happy! I was so happy I jumped! I was so grateful for that title.</p><p><em>What advice would you give to others aspringing to be LR of the week?</em></p><p>The most important advice for those who want to be LR of the week - never give up, believe in yourself! This will help you stay motivated. Try to be active, be on every shift you can and try to get Hardworker on shifts! Also, don&#x27;t forget to write or talk on the communications server Teethyz! If you manage to do this, you have a chance to be LR of the week!</p><p><em>How has your experience been at Teethyz Dentist so far?</em></p><p>As soon as I joined teehyz I knew I would love this game! After becoming a Staff member I would enter the game every day and claim appointments. That&#x27;s how fast I became an Oral Surgeon, in less than 2 weeks! Back then, you had to have a lot more points to become an Oral Surgeon. After becoming an Oral Surgeon, I took a break because I didn&#x27;t have time for teethyz. Just about a month ago I decided to come back! C:</p><p>Interviewer: alzssi</p><p>Interviewee: crimetats</p><p><em>What was your initial reaction upon seeing that you received the &quot;Low rank of the Week&quot; award?</em></p><p>1) I think I was initially shocked when I got pinged and saw the message in staff announcements, but I was very happy getting it and I am very thankful for being selected as LR of the week.</p><p><em>What advice would you give to others aspringing to be LR of the week?</em></p><p>2)  Advice I’d give.. hm very tricky question but I believe my advice will be it’s very easy to be unmotivated so I suggest playing with friends during shifts or try connecting with others, and of course, y’all probably heard this many times but putting in hard work does pull off, so don’t feel saddened if you feel like your efforts aren’t showing, I promise they are! 🙂</p><p><em>How has your experience been at Teethyz dentist so far?</em></p><p>3) I’ll be 100% honest.. at first it was intimidating mostly because of how tight knit Teethyz was, so I felt unsure and a bit shy I suppose, haha, but after few days I got to meet plenty of friendly and supportive people. I plan on improving my communication skills to hopefully make more friends at the dentist. 😄
Last but not least, Alliance of the Month! </p><p>Interviewer: SiimplyBunnwy</p><p>Interviewee: Hokui PR</p><p><em>What has working with Teethyz been like form an affiliate perspective?</em></p><p>Working with Teethyz over these past few months has been an incredible experience! We&#x27;re very thankful for what the partnership has brought us and we hope to be able to collaborate on some exciting events for both communities to enjoy for the upcoming months. Their relations team has shown a lot of commitment and ensured stable communication within both groups despite not having the chance to collaborate yet. Overall, Hokui&#x27;s relations team is very happy to be affiliated with Teethyz and we&#x27;re very excited to see what this partnership has in store for us in the future.</p><p><em>What advice would you share with people who would like to get into PR in the future?</em></p><p>If you wish to become a Public Relations member in the future, I&#x27;d definitely say that it&#x27;s important to be dedicated to the group, but to also find balance. Don&#x27;t overwork yourself and demotivate yourself, you should enjoy working up. I promise that you&#x27;ll enjoy your position more if you find balance and that your time will come. Moreover, It&#x27;s important to be very communicative with your peers as it will be an essential skill once you do join the department, especially when it come to planning events and talking to alliances.</p><p><em>What is your favourite memory as a PR member with Teethyz?</em></p><p>I just recently joined the Hokui relations team so there isn&#x27;t much yet, but from my knowledge our team enjoys the check-ins that Teethyz does. But one of our greatest memories was most likely the start of our partnership as we knew it would lead to great things for both groups, and we&#x27;re very excited to collaborate on future events with Teethyz.</p><p> — <em>Section written by: SiimplyBunnwy</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb354a82-bce7-470f-967e-531f825a0036" alt="October Tiktok 2024" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/539444c6-5311-4bc1-8319-2653003dc858" alt="October Tiktok 2024" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>— <em>Section made by: 17thwish</em></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b20f561-0dcd-4dcc-8680-62861d604ac6" alt="October Birthdays 2024" class="img_mf7_"></p><p>▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂</p><p>This month we have been celebrating multiple MR+ birthdays!
