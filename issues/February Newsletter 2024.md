╭  ﹒ **February Awareness** ∿   ˖  ݁ . 

・ Hey, everyone! I hope you are enjoying the February Newsletter so far. Throughout this great month, there are tons of things to celebrate. The month of February is very important as it celebrates black history month, Marti Gras and lunar new year! Below are a few descriptions of these important occurrences.

**Black history month:**

Black History Month is an important celebration that honors the achievements and contributions of Black individuals throughout history. It's a time to recognize their impact on society, culture, and civil rights. We remember individuals like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Harriet Tubman who fought for equality and justice. It's a month filled with learning, reflection, and appreciation for the rich history.

**Marti Gras:**

Mardi Gras is a vibrant and festive celebration that takes place before the season of Lent. It's most famously celebrated in New Orleans, Louisiana, but also in other parts of the world too. During Mardi Gras, people dress up in colorful costumes, enjoy parades with many floats, and eat delicious foods. It's a time for joy, music, and spending time together.

**Lunar new year:**

Lunar New Year is a festive celebration which marks the start of the lunar calendar. It's a time for family, delicious food, and colorful traditions. People gather with their loved ones, exchange red envelopes filled with money, and enjoy special meals together. The streets are filled with vibrant parades, dances, and fireworks. It's an amazing time filled with hope, good fortune, and pleasant wishes for the year ahead.

╭ ʚ  ‧˚ 🩷 **Valentines Day Interviews!**

Greetings, Teethyz community! We hope you had a great Valentines Day! We got the chance to interview a few MRs+ what their favourite way to spend Valentines day is! And with who!



‧˚ **Interviewer: NewSwitcherop**


 ‧˚ **Interviewee: emi_emiiiiiiiiii**



╭ ʚ  ‧˚ 🩷 Question 1


**What is your favorite way to spend Valentines day?**

Probably with friends, as I haven't had a valentine ever so i'd rather do Valentines day with my friends! We did a sleepover this year and it was fun. I also give gifts and cards during valentines day to my friends as its called ''friends day'' around here and give them out on the specific day (valentines) when we trade the gifts we have bought and made.

╭ ʚ  ‧˚ 🩷 Question 2


**Who are some people that you love? How have they put a positive impact on your life?**

I love my family and all friends. With my family i can be whoever I want as a person. They have raised me and i will be forever grateful to be put in this family. My mom, my dad and my siblings will always be there for me. My friends are the people I care the most after my family, they make me laugh and make me feel better I can be myself and they can too with me and i feel so privileged for my friend group. Because of them I wont be alone in school and I'll have a person to talk to when my parents don't get it.



‧˚ **Interviewer: NewSwitcherop**


 ‧˚ **Interviewee : fantzsq**



╭ ʚ  ‧˚ 🩷 Question 1


**What is your favorite way to spend Valentines day?**

I love to spend valentines day with my family and my friends if they're available. Sometimes we would go out for dinner and watch a film when we get back to "spread the love" and spend time with each other. 

╭ ʚ  ‧˚ 🩷 Question 2


**Who are some people that you love? How have they put a positive impact on your life?**

I'd say a lot of people here at Teethyz. Before I came here I was struggling to find people that actually care and when Ipassed tsa Ifelt really welcomed. Even though it's just a Roblox group, everyone here has made a positive impact by making me feel loved and I'm super grateful for that.

♪ › **Guess The Song**


On Monday, the first day of the spirit week, there was supposed to be a "Guess The Song" game night. Sadly, this event couldn't take place due to technical difficulties, but the following mini-games just got better and better!

❥ › **Valentine's Cards**


On the 13th of February, the second day of our spirit week, EleqantEmma hosted an unbelievably creative "Valentine's Letters" event. Here, you had the opportunity to write one or multiple letters to your loved ones. This event was really successful, as over 300 letters were sent.

☻ › **Guess Who**


On the sixth day of our spirit week, XxCandy2372xX planned a "Be Mine" festival. Sadly, it didn't take place due to technical difficulties. But wait! Chrissy still managed to host an amazing game night, Guess Who! At the dentist, there were cutouts of our MR+'s avatars and they were also described. The first to guess the MR correctly won! Congratulations to everyone who won during this mini-game.

❤︎ › **Heart PNG**


For the last day of our spirit week, PerfectlyAnnie and Kecai hosted an adorable event together, "Heart PNGs". This was such a cute event to end things off with as everyone was able to send their personalized hearts and what they love in #community-photos. This was, as all the other ones, an amazing event which I and many others truly enjoyed.

This was a summary of our spirit week. I hope you all enjoyed and, if you participated, had fun! Which of these was your favourite event? Let me know! :）

Greeting once again Teethyz, and welcome back to our Of The Month section! In this section you will find out about our Alliance of the month, our MR of the month, and our HR of the month! Let's start with our MR of the month!

Our MR Of The Month was… **Cas6nx (Casen)**! We are all very proud of him for winning such a highly esteemed award! I was able to get an exclusive interview with Casen as a part of this, so read and enjoy!



**Interviewer: Furnface**


**Interviewee: Cas6nx (Casen)**


▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂


Q(Furnface) What was your reaction to getting MR of the month?



A(Casen) I was really surprised!



▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂


Q(Furnface) What’s some advice you would give to LR’s trying to be an MR one day.



A(Casen) Be active, but not so much that you burn yourself out. Also, you need to be consistent! Instead of doing 200+ minutes in one day then 0 the next, do 45-60 minutes a week!



▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂


Q(Furnface) What’s some advice you would give to MR’s trying to one day get MR of the month.



A(Casen) I don't know how they pick MROTM, but I would say to be active in game and also be respectful and professional.



Some great words from Casen and we congratulate him on the amazing achievements and getting MR of the month! Now for our HR of the month segment! Our HR for the month of December was… **vcorria (Victoria)**. Congratulations to vcorria on getting this amazing achievement! As a part of this, Mahdia got an interview with vcorria!


**Interviewer: Mrs_KawaiiCat (Mahdia)**
**Interviewee: vcorria**


「 Q1. What was your reaction to getting HR of the month?  」

⭒ A1. I was pretty shocked getting HROTM! I immediately wanted to find a cute profile picture to match my role color!



「 Q2. What’s some advice you would give to LR’s trying to be an MR one day?  」

⭒ A2. Some advice I would give to LR’s is staying active and consistent! Going in-game everyday for only 15+ minutes is a big deal!




「 Q3. What’s some advice you would give to HR’s trying to one day get HR of the month?  」

⭒ A3. Advice I would give to HR's trying to get HROTM one day is, interacting and being active! Activity I feel like is a big part even if you are a LR and overall just interacting with everybody and communicating well!「 Q1. What was your reaction to getting HR of the month?  」



Some great words from vcorria  and we are all very proud of her momentous achievement as earning an award like HR of the month is no easy task! Now our next section is our alliance of the month!

**Interviewer: Furnface**



**Interviewee: mwaniacss**

▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂



Q (Furnface) What is it like working with Teethyz Dentist from an alliance perspective.



A (mwaniacss) Working with Teethyz from an alliance perspective is incredibly nice.Teethyz MRs and HRs shows insane amount of love which Boba appreciate a lot. In the past few days that I have been in PR, teethyz has shown great support and I am grateful that we are allied with Teethyz for that.


▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂



Q (Furnface) What is it like working with Teethyz to make these PR events that both of our staff teams love very much.



A (mwaniacss) Working with the Teethyz PR team for events is such a great feeling. Both our teams are amazing workers and the fact that we can bond to create fun events for others is very rewarding. Can't wait to host more event with Teethyz!
