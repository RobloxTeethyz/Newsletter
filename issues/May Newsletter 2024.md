୧ ﹒**Mother's Day Section!**

Greetings! We hope that you are enjoying our Newsletter so far. In this section, our Newsletter Team has taken some time to write about Mother's Day and interview some MRs+ about it! Below this message, you will learn about Mother's Day culture, and what it is. Enjoy!



*What is Mother's Day about?*



Mother's Day is a holiday that was created by Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia. The reason why Mother's Day was created was so we can spend more time with our mother.



Anna Jarvis came up with the holiday of Mother's Day because her mother would normally organise groups of women to promote friendship and health. *



Mother's Day is a very special day, with many very special celebrations and traditions. How do people celebrate Mother's Day? Some people like to give gifts, cook, bake cookies, or giving a nice bouquet of flowers! What did you give your loved one(s) this year?

**Finals/end of school year tips**


Greetings everyone! For this month’s Newsletter we have decided to give you a section regarding Finals, tips how to pass, and how to end a school year with the most fun as possible. I hope you enjoy this section and happy reading!


__**Finals Tips:**__


- Keep calm, you got this.
- Revise in advance so that you’re prepared.
- Revise with a friend, to make it not as boring.
- When revising find the best method how to, for example using an App, writing on Paper or prepare Index Cards. (You can look up more methods, some of them really help.)
- A bad grade won’t be the end of your life, so don’t let that bring you down.
- Talk to your parents, sibling or friends about the subject to make sure you’re prepared.
- Create a study plan.
- Manage your time affectively.
- And last but not least, do what works for you, these above are just Tips, you don’t have to follow anything of it.


**__How to end a good school year:__**


- Don't get into drama! I know it's the end of the year, but when you come back next year, it doesn't look good on you.
- Study! This is really important. Studying will really help raise up your report card marks.
- Try to make friend groups! This will be helpful so that next year, you will already have people to hang out with.
- Don't be disrespectful to anyone! If you are rude to anyone, it will not look good on yourself. People may not want to hang out with you anymore.
- Hang out with your friends outside of school! Doing this will help you create a stronger bond with your friends.
- Have a routine! This will keep yourself healthy and organized, it's a really nice feeling.
- Countdown the days until school ends! This will encourage you to work hard each day, knowing that you don't have much days of school left.
- You can also do whatever works best for you! It's always good to do things that you want to do.

୧ **Question:** *Did you have any strategies that helped you win the Disney Guess The Song? If so, what were they?*


୧ **Answer:** *Well, if being a big Disney fan counts as a strategy, then I would say yes! I just adore visiting the Disney theme parks, listening to Disney music, and watching Disney movies and shows.*


୧ **Question:** *What was your reaction to winning?*


୧ **Answer:** *I was honestly shocked! This was one of the first events that I had taken part in here at Teethyz, and it was so much fun. I remember laughing and smiling the whole game. Winning was just a bonus of an already amazing event.*

୧ **Question:** *Did you have any strategies that helped you win the Disney Guess The Song? If so, what were they?*


୧ **Answer:** *To be honest, I had no strategies! I didn’t expect to win. I just joined the Disney Guess The Song for fun as I don’t normally win these games.However, Witty said the songs started off easy and got harder so I predicted the first song would be Let It Go. So that’s how I got my first point!*


୧ **Question:** *What was your reaction to winning?*


୧ **Answer:** *I was quite shocked as I am not the biggest Disney fan on the planet and I can’t remember the last time I watched a Disney film. But I was very pleased with myself and felt accomplished that I came 2nd.*


୧ **Question:** *Who is your favorite Disney character?*


୧ **Answer:** *This is a tricky question! However my favourite Disney character would probably be Rapunzel from Tangled because I love her hair and I think her pet chameleon, Pascal is super cute!*

୧ **Answer:** *I was pretty happy! Although it was just a small game, I really enjoyed it and made some friends aswell!*

୧ **Question:** *Did you have any strategies that helped you win the Disney Spot The Difference? If so, what were they?*


୧ **Answer:** *HONESTLY my strategy was to compare to pictures as quick as possible, I looked at common things, hair, animals, clothes, colors, shapes! I just knew that if I wanted to win I had to do it QUICKLY! I finished within 45 seconds ish and was extremely rushed!*

୧ **Question:** *What was your reaction to winning?*


୧ **Answer:** *When I won, I was shocked! I did it all in a rush right before school so to see I actually earnt a place was amazing! I also was impressed at the 2 other people on the podium for also completing the challenge.*

⋆.˚ ᡣ𐭩 . 👗 **Met Gala Outfits**


Greetings, Teethyz community! On May 6th, 2024, was the annual Met Gala. We've decided to bring out our inner fashion designers and take our 5 favorite outfits to share with you all!
 

⋆.˚ - (Didi_ek: Kylie Jenner)


・For me, Kylie's outfit was probably the prettiest. Her dress was gorgeous, and the details looked divine. Kylie had perfect hair and looked absolutely stunning.
 

⋆.˚ - (Didi_ek: Jennie)


・And of course, Jennie from Blackpink must not be missing on this list! I absolutely adored her blue dress and heels. Her earrings were beautiful, and so was her hair. Jennie looked perfect!
 

⋆.˚ - (Didi_ek: Tyla)


・Tyla also had a very strange outfit. Her sand dress looked absolutely interesting, and so did the hourglass in her hand. Overall, she looked very beautiful.
 

⋆.˚ - (iichxr_1: Cardi B)


・Cardi B looked absolutely breathtaking in her picturesque, ruffled black gown and fur black ushanka hat. Her confidence and looks absolutely stole the show. 
 

⋆.˚ - (iichxr_1: Jessica Biel)


・Jessica Biel, wearing Cartier and Tamara Ralph, truly left us all with our mouths open in shock. Her flowy, pink dress with 3D floral elements gave her an aura of elegance while also matching the theme of the night.
 

And that's all from us! We hope you enjoyed our reviews, and perhaps you even agree with some of them! Here's to a new month everyone!

⋆.˚ ᡣ𐭩 . 🗒️  **OTM Interviews**


Greetings Teethyz community! This month, I was given the opportunity to interview our lovely OTM winners (myself included). Below was what some of them had to say, plus a few tips for any aspiring MR's or HR's!


---------


**MROTM:**


⋆.˚ - Interviewer: iichxr_1 (Yes, I’m aware of the irony. No comment).


⋆.˚ - Interviewee: iichxr_1 


--------- 


・**Q:** What do you like to do in your spare time?


・**A:** Well, I tend to cook and watch Youtube! On occasion I’ll also take walks and help my father with yard work. 


・**Q:** What was your reaction to getting MROTM?


・**A:** To be honest, I was shocked. I was in class (talking to Pluto on my phone, but regardless), and suddenly I got a flood of pings. When I saw I had won I was speechless. I was getting spammed from a bunch of people and I just couldn’t have felt happier. I was, and still am, so so grateful. 


・**Q:** What's some advice you would give LR’s trying to become MR one day?


・A: This is tricky. When trying to get MR, I know this advice is going to sound cliche and overused, but it’s advice many LR’s ignore anyways. Do NOT overwork yourself. Sure, activity is important. But nothing is so important that you should be in game for hours upon hours, disregarding your wellbeing for a promotion on an online game. It’s not worth it, you will burn out, and you will want to give up faster. 


・**Q:** What was your journey here in the Teethyz community like?


・**A:** Oh boy, well, that's a long period of time to sum up. But I’ll do the best I can. In October, 2021, I became an LR for the first time. I passed the very first TSA wave on January 3rd, 2022. Huge accomplishment considering it was the first wave (so most likely many applicants) and only around 24 people passed. Then, in April, I resigned. In May, I passed MOD trials, but resigned shortly after. Around June, I left for a little more than a year, and came back in September 2023. I became an MR in February, 2024, and the rest most of you already know.


--------- 


**HROTM:**


⋆.˚ - Interviewer: iichxr_1


⋆.˚ - Interviewee: TailaBzp

--------- 


・**Q:** What do you like to do in your spare time?


・**A:** I like watching YouTube, Tiktok and Instagram Reels, Twitter and reading.


・**Q:** What was your reaction to getting HROTM?


・**A:** I was very angry, because my friend, Sammie, woke me up 40 minutes before my alarm went off. But I was quite happy afterwards.


・**Q:** What's some advice you would give LR’s trying to become HR’s one day?


・**A:** That's a great question. My advice is to think of situations from an HR viewpoint. That may help you prepare for the position. I think it's also important to have a big footprint in the community.


・**Q:** What was your journey here in the Teethyz community like?


・**A:** My MR journey was great. I ranked up fairly fast and, in my opinion, I feel like I got the hang of things pretty quick. HR was pretty good and still is good. I was an EA for 8 months, but that was the only major stop in my journey here.


--------- 


**Alliance OTM:**


⋆.˚ - Interviewer: iichxr_1


⋆.˚ - Interviewee: Hokui Public Relations 


--------- 


・**Q:** What has working with Teethyz been like from an affiliate perspective?


・**A:** Working with Teethyz from an affiliate perspective has been awesome! They have amazing communication with constant checkups and in-game visits. We have been able to grow our partnership a lot and have so much love for the alliance.


・**Q:** What's something you've enjoyed whilst being affiliated with Teethyz?


・**A:** Something we've enjoyed while being in an alliance with Teethyz is having so many visit memories and also getting to speak with each other's Public Relations Teams. Some of our favorite memories will be below!


・**Q:** Can you share one memorable factor of Teethyz Dentist that stands out to you?


・**A:** One favorable memory that stands out to us is when we got to visit Teethyz for our first time. We had a group of Hokui Management Team Members visit the Dentistry!


I hope you enjoyed hearing from our OTM winners! Stay cool, Teethyians.
