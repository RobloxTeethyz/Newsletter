୧ ﹒**Mother's Day Section!**

Greetings! We hope that you are enjoying our Newsletter so far. In this section, our Newsletter Team has taken some time to write about Mother's Day and interview some MRs+ about it! Below this message, you will learn about Mother's Day culture, and what it is. Enjoy!



*What is Mother's Day about?*



Mother's Day is a holiday that was created by Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia. The reason why Mother's Day was created was so we can spend more time with our mother.



Anna Jarvis came up with the holiday of Mother's Day because her mother would normally organise groups of women to promote friendship and health. *



Mother's Day is a very special day, with many very special celebrations and traditions. How do people celebrate Mother's Day? Some people like to give gifts, cook, bake cookies, or giving a nice bouquet of flowers! What did you give your loved one(s) this year?

**Finals/end of school year tips**


Greetings everyone! For this month’s Newsletter we have decided to give you a section regarding Finals, tips how to pass, and how to end a school year with the most fun as possible. I hope you enjoy this section and happy reading!


__**Finals Tips:**__


- Keep calm, you got this.
- Revise in advance so that you’re prepared.
- Revise with a friend, to make it not as boring.
- When revising find the best method how to, for example using an App, writing on Paper or prepare Index Cards. (You can look up more methods, some of them really help.)
- A bad grade won’t be the end of your life, so don’t let that bring you down.
- Talk to your parents, sibling or friends about the subject to make sure you’re prepared.
- Create a study plan.
- Manage your time affectively.
- And last but not least, do what works for you, these above are just Tips, you don’t have to follow anything of it.


**__How to end a good school year:__**


- Don't get into drama! I know it's the end of the year, but when you come back next year, it doesn't look good on you.
- Study! This is really important. Studying will really help raise up your report card marks.
- Try to make friend groups! This will be helpful so that next year, you will already have people to hang out with.
- Don't be disrespectful to anyone! If you are rude to anyone, it will not look good on yourself. People may not want to hang out with you anymore.
- Hang out with your friends outside of school! Doing this will help you create a stronger bond with your friends.
- Have a routine! This will keep yourself healthy and organized, it's a really nice feeling.
- Countdown the days until school ends! This will encourage you to work hard each day, knowing that you don't have much days of school left.
- You can also do whatever works best for you! It's always good to do things that you want to do.
