Happy 2025! I hope your year started off with a blast, with many traditions and fun celebrations along the way. A common tradition around the world is to set a goal for yourself to achieve in the new year, that being a resolution! These resolutions are made to help you set yourself up to have a bright new year, to accomplish goals, or to try something you've never done before! Sometimes these are met, and sometimes they are not. Resolutions can be hard to keep up with, but with the right mindset, it can happen! It is also never too late to start making resolutions, even if it is already 2025! If you care to make a resolution for yourself, but are unsure of where to start, look down below for some examples!

 **⤹  : Resolution Ideas:・**

・Being closer to a loved one.

・Become healthier.

・Get good grades.

・Go somewhere you have never been before.

・Try out a new hobby.

・Play more Teethyz!

    I hope this helped a little bit! Now, we are going to hear from a select individual  about their New Year's resolutions and what they did!

 **⤹  : crimetats Interview:・**

*Interviewer: fvIsegod*

*Interviewed: crimetats*

Question: What were your New Year's Resolutions, if you had any? If not, why didn't you make one?

Answer: "My New Year Resolution is to improve at communicating with old friends and close the chapter of the old past. In my personal belief, I think that some friends are here for one chapter of your life while others are here for the whole book which has taught me a lot."

I hope you read through this section and were possibly inspired to create a resolution for this year or the upcoming year. Happy 2025!

![January Study Tips 2025](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/420f25cc-9503-4d3c-b05e-7832bf40a6fa)


▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂

Studying can sometimes feel challenging, but having the right strategies can make it seem less overwhelming. Whether you’re looking to stay organized, improve on your focus, or make your studying more productive, we’ve decided to put together some study tips to help you! 

**˗ˏˋRemoving distractions: ´ˎ˗**

- Removing distractions can be an essential study tip because it helps you focus and concentrate more. When you remove any distractions, such as your phone or any background noise, you can pay more attention to your work. This means you should also find a place where you will have no distractions around you, such as the library! It makes it easier to concentrate, understand, and remember what you're studying for, which can make your studying time more efficient.

**˗ˏˋUsing extra homework/exams: ´ˎ˗**

- When it comes to finding other resources to help you study, using extra exams and homework can be beneficial! They give you more practice and help you get familiar with the concepts and types of questions you might be facing. Using extra exams or homework can also help you build confidence, improve your skills, and get used to different formats, so you're more prepared!

**- ˗ˏˋTaking break: ´ˎ˗**

- When working on an assignment for a long period of time without any breaks, it can make you feel stressed, overwhelmed, and lose your focus. That is why it is important for you to take short breaks every once in a while. By taking short breaks, you’re giving your mind a chance to rest, which can help you feel less stressed out and help you remember what you’re trying to study for!

**˗ˏˋStaying organized: ´ˎ˗**

- Another study tip that can help you study and be more organized with school, used to get a planner! A planner can help you have organized times of when you’re gonna study and do homework! I recommend getting a planner with something you like on it as it will make you want to use it more!

**˗ˏˋListening to music: ´ˎ˗**

- Something I recommend for studying is listening to music! Music is a common tool that is used to help many people in classrooms at home or anywhere to study and get things done! I always recommend listening to instrumental music as music with lyrics can get distracting when trying to study and focus on the assignment at hand!

**˗ˏˋChewing gum: ´ˎ˗**

- One thing I would love to have one studying is gum! I think gum is a really good tool and can help relieve a lot of stress! I was recommending sugar-free gum, but really any gum works! Gum is found to improve attentiveness, and help you be more focused and alert! It can also help to wake your brain up and help with cognitive Processes.

Hey Teethyz! I hope you’re loving the newsletter so far—it’s always so exciting to see you here! This month, I’m bringing some super important news to your attention. Being aware of what’s happening around the world is such a big deal, and I’m so glad you’re taking the time to read this. Feel free to share what you learn with your friends and family—it’s a great way to spread awareness! Without further ado, let’s dive into this month’s awareness section and learn together!

── ࣪˖  ࣪ ⊹ ࣪ ˖ ──

**⤥ : LA Fires.**

The recent fires in Los Angeles, California, which started on January 7th, have caused devastating damage to families, homes, and wildlife. Over 40,000 acres of land have been burnt, and many people have lost their homes and belongings. These fires were fueled by extreme weather, and they continue to threaten the area. It’s heart-breaking to see families leave behind everything they own, not sure of what they’ll return to. Volunteers are stepping up to help with evacuation efforts and provide support, showing how strong communities can be in tough times. If you want to help, consider donating to disaster relief organizations or simply spreading awareness to keep others informed. Though the situation is overwhelming, every act of kindness, big or small, can make a difference in supporting those affected. Let’s keep them in our hearts as they navigate these challenging times.

**⤥ : Martin Luther King Day.**

Martin Luther King Day, celebrated on January 20th, honors Martin Luther King Jr. and everything he did to fight for equality. He believed in peaceful protests and used his words, not violence, to stand up against racism and unfair treatment. Back then, people of color faced unfair rules, like being forced to use separate places and being denied basic rights. But Martin Luther King Jr. inspired many people to join his fight for justice and because of him, important laws were passed to protect everyone’s rights and end unfair treatment. We remember him not just on January 20th but every day by standing up for fairness, kindness, and treating everyone with respect.

**⤥ : National hug Day!**

National Hug Day, celebrated on January 21st, is the perfect excuse to share some love and warmth! It’s a day to appreciate and remember how a simple hug can change your whole mood or somebody else’s. Whether it’s a big warm hug or a quick squeeze, hugs have the power to reduce stress, increase happiness, and make our connections with others even stronger! Plus they’re free, easy, and always amazing! So, let’s spread those good vibes, give a hug, and feel the positive energy bounce right back. Sometimes, all it takes is a hug to make someone’s day a little brighter!

**⤥ : National Religious Freedom Day.**

Religious Freedom Day, commemorated on January 16th, is a day to celebrate the freedom to follow any religion, or no religion at all, without being treated unfairly. This day marks the anniversary of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which was signed into law in 1786. It’s a reminder that everyone has the right to believe in what they choose and feel comfortable with, supporting tolerance, understanding, and respect for different beliefs. Let’s take a moment to appreciate the importance of this freedom, and remember that embracing varieties and diversites strengthens our communities.

- A3: My main goal is pretty simple, I just want to find the perfect balance between real and online life. I made a few pretty dumb decisions about this lately, and that’s why I really wanna change on that!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀— ˗ˋ ୨୧ ˊ˗ —

*Interviewer: S7icy*

*Interviewee Emmaliini08 (January 7th)*

A1: I was pretty schocked to be honest. I was not expecting that since I have seen so many other active and amazing LRs in game!

A2: It's not about how many appointments you do as long as you try your best to claim them. Also helping If you see someone in need of that. attending shifts can help a lot on getting the role and they also are a fun way to spend time!

A3: It has been great. Since I resigned from MR back in 2023 and now came back I have had a very positive experience here and had fun!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀— ˗ˋ ୨୧ ˊ˗ —

*Interviewer: S7icy*

*Interviewee Mayalqvv (January 14th)*

A1: i was genuinely shocked, especially when seeing all the pings! i am so glad i had this opportunity, and i cannot wait to see who achieves it next!

A2: stay active, put effort into appointments when booking them and when claiming them! when others have a question, try your best to answer them and guide through the experience!

A3: it has been wonderful! its something i look forward to playing everyday, and i have made many friends along the way!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀— ˗ˋ ୨୧ ˊ˗ —

*Interviewer: S7icy*

*Interviewee seraphelie (January 20th)*

A1: I wasn't really expecting it but I opened discord to a ton of pings and I was like omg wow!! I WAS REALLY HAPPY AND EXCITED THOUGH!

A2: Honestly I would say don't think about it/prioritize that as your main goal. Don't stress yourself out and just have fun playing the game!! 🤍

A3: It has been a lot of ups and downs but I'm so so grateful to be apart of this community! I've met so many amazing people in my time here at Teethyz and I'm excited to see where the future takes me.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀— ˗ˋ ୨୧ ˊ˗ —

*Interviewer: s9phzie*

*Interviewee a7ix_z  (January 27th)*

A1: At first, I was SHOCKED by the amount of pings that I got because it’s definitely been a very long time since I’ve been pinged this many times at Teethyz. Although, I don’t even know how to describe this feeling, but it’s kind of overwhelming in a way? Like, I definitely did not expect THIS much attention. I’d say it’s a mix of excitement and confusion! Either way, it’s a strange feeling, but I felt very flattered.

A2: Well… to begin, it takes some time. My biggest advice for every LR out there is to NEVER overwork yourself. No matter if it’s 15 minutes or 15 hours that you spend grinding at Teethyz daily, it’s all about quality, not quantity. As long as you’re putting in effort, staying professional, remaining active and having a good attitude, I doubt that you will have a problem with being noticed. When you’re doing your best, it’ll come naturally!

A3: Ever since I returned back to Teethyz, it has felt like jumping back into a group chat that I left on read for WAY too long. A little chaotic, a little overwhelming, but also really fun! So much has changed, yet somehow it still has some sort of a nostalgic feeling to it. I’ve reconnected with my friends, which I’m so grateful for, met new people and if I’m being completely honest, I didn’t expect to enjoy it this much. It’s been a joyful rollercoaster and I’m just here for it at this point!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀╭┈ • ┈ ୨୧ ┈ • ┈╮

⋆.˚ALLIANCE Interview:₊⊹⁀➴ Boba

*Interviewer: S7icy*
*Interviewee silentccry (Boba's PR)*

Q1: How would you describe your experience working in the Alliance Public Relations Department?

- A1: Working in the Public Relations team at Boba has been such a refreshing experience. Ever since I joined the department roughly a year ago, I have met such a new aspect of Boba and soon enough found a new passion. I have got to meet amazing people that I can now call my best friends and it honestly is just so heartwarming. I also got to host so many events alongside others, which in fact helped me become a bit more social! Overall, I absolutely love the experience I am currently living and wouldn’t trade it for anything.

Q2: What advice would you offer to those interested in becoming a PR?

- A2: Such a good question! I personally would just say, enjoy what you are doing. The more you like what is presented to you, the more you will have a fun time. Don’t be afraid to show off what you can do! We all have a creative side that deserves to be shown and I think that PR really helps showing it, so don’t be scared! Keep in mind that you don’t have to be extra social to be into the department, so don’t pressure yourself into anything! Just take it easy and as long as you are enjoying your work, then you’ll have such a great experience.

Q3: What has your experience been like collaborating with Teethyz as an alliance?

- A3: Oo, that’s interesting! Teethyz is such an awesome alliance of ours and we are all so grateful to have them by our side. They are extremely supportive towards us, and constantly checks up on us! I see their staff team very often at our café and they also are very welcoming whenever I go to visit, which I appreciate so much! Teethyz is also a great partner to host event with! Their creativity and fun vibe really brings out such an amazing mood in the end. I’m speaking on behalf of our Public Relations team members right now but I think we can all agree that Teethyz is a wonderful affiliate and that we’ve all had positive experiences with them!

Hello, Teethyz! For this section, me (luckuley) and Marielle (S7icy) have gathered an overview on the amazing promotions that occurred this month, alongside a few interviews we conducted with some of the MR+ that got promoted! We hope you enjoy reading!

**‧₊˚ ⋅ ౨ৎ  ‧₊ (stcrsets) Promoted to (Executive Director PR).ᐟ **

- ⤷ i was absolutely speechless, kenzie had scared me so bad i didn't know what to say or do. it was so unexpected! i was so happy though and excited!!

  **‧₊˚ ⋅ ౨ৎ  ‧₊ (zupreh) Promoted to (Supervisor).ᐟ **
  
- ⤷ My first reaction was when I saw Leah's announcement, my heart honestly skipped a beat. Me and Laura was talking about promotions last night or maybe the night before, and she was saying that I'm 100% getting promo some time soon. Clearly, she can go into the future because I'd love to know how she knew that. Anyway, Leah said "Someone cheated in Red Light, Green Light, and asked everyone if she could call them out." Now, I said yes and uhm, I was brought to Leah. Now, at first I genuinely thought it was a mistake because I had shiftlock on and I was facing another Supervisor. So, I looked at leah and said Uhm... Anyways, she said I cheated and said "As a New Supervisor, you shouldn't be doing that" etc etc. I can't fully remember what she said because I was in shock. But, thats when the tears started. I full on cried. OF JOY!!! and then my laptop nearly crashed from how many people was jumping around me and then the like 2 million pings started coming through. Thank you so much Leah, I'm so happy to be apart of the Lehoco family and the Teethyz community. And, a huge thank you to tradewinds2810 (evie) which was my TSA mentor!! ❤️

**‧₊˚ ⋅ ౨ৎ  ‧₊ (Iluvura) Promoted to (Office Manager).ᐟ**

- ⤷ When I first got promoted, my initial reaction was a mix of shock and also nervousness. I was co-hosting a session when Jayden suddenly came in, mentioning that someone had been disturbing the session and acting unprofessionally. For a moment, I felt scared, thinking I might have done something wrong. Then Jayden "called me out" and teleported me to the host’s spot. That’s when he promoted me to Office Manager. I was shocked, my hands were shaking, and I couldn’t believe what had just happened. I didn’t expect it at all, and honestly, it still feels surreal!

   ⠄･ ⋆ ･ ⠄⠂⋆ ･ ⠄⠂⋆ ･ ⠄⠄･ ⋆ ･ ⠄⠂⋆ ･ ⠄⠂⋆ ･ ⠄
  
**‧₊˚ ⋅ ౨ৎ  ‧₊ (jqhcnna) Promoted to (Dental boards).ᐟ**

- ⤷ To be honest, I didn't expect it at all. During my promotion I was on call with Jayden and a few others. My reaction was that I didn't see it coming, I didn't know what to say at all because I was just shocked. I was shaking and so happy. At first, I couldn’t even reply to all the pings and messages because I was extremely shocked. It was really late for me and I wanted to go to sleep but then I saw this message and all these pings, I was awake all night because I didn't expect it at this moment. I was so happy for this opportunity and appreciate it so so much. It means a lot to me and I just want to say that my DMs are always open to anything!

**‧₊˚ ⋅ ౨ৎ  ‧₊ (lcuraas) Promoted to (Assistant Manager).ᐟ**

- ⤷ so fun fact I was on call with amelia, and my first reaction was staring at it blankly (I was really excited and happy bare in mind) and saying “I just got assistant manager” and Amelia’s reply was “no you didn’t” and she started screaming excitedly at me But I was extremely happy!!
