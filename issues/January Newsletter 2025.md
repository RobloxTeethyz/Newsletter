Happy 2025! I hope your year started off with a blast, with many traditions and fun celebrations along the way. A common tradition around the world is to set a goal for yourself to achieve in the new year, that being a resolution! These resolutions are made to help you set yourself up to have a bright new year, to accomplish goals, or to try something you've never done before! Sometimes these are met, and sometimes they are not. Resolutions can be hard to keep up with, but with the right mindset, it can happen! It is also never too late to start making resolutions, even if it is already 2025! If you care to make a resolution for yourself, but are unsure of where to start, look down below for some examples!

 ⤹  : Resolution Ideas:・

・Being closer to a loved one.
・Become healthier.
・Get good grades.
・Go somewhere you have never been before.
・Try out a new hobby.
・Play more Teethyz!

    I hope this helped a little bit! Now, we are going to hear from a select individual  about their New Year's resolutions and what they did!

Interviewed: crimetats
Question: What were your New Year's Resolutions, if you had any? If not, why didn't you make one?
Answer: "My New Year Resolution is to improve at communicating with old friends and close the chapter of the old past. In my personal belief, I think that some friends are here for one chapter of your life while others are here for the whole book which has taught me a lot."

I hope you read through this section and were possibly inspired to create a resolution for this year or the upcoming year. Happy 2025!
