Happy 2025! I hope your year started off with a blast, with many traditions and fun celebrations along the way. A common tradition around the world is to set a goal for yourself to achieve in the new year, that being a resolution! These resolutions are made to help you set yourself up to have a bright new year, to accomplish goals, or to try something you've never done before! Sometimes these are met, and sometimes they are not. Resolutions can be hard to keep up with, but with the right mindset, it can happen! It is also never too late to start making resolutions, even if it is already 2025! If you care to make a resolution for yourself, but are unsure of where to start, look down below for some examples!

 **⤹  : Resolution Ideas:・**

・Being closer to a loved one.

・Become healthier.

・Get good grades.

・Go somewhere you have never been before.

・Try out a new hobby.

・Play more Teethyz!

    I hope this helped a little bit! Now, we are going to hear from a select individual  about their New Year's resolutions and what they did!

*Interviewed: crimetats*

Question: What were your New Year's Resolutions, if you had any? If not, why didn't you make one?

Answer: "My New Year Resolution is to improve at communicating with old friends and close the chapter of the old past. In my personal belief, I think that some friends are here for one chapter of your life while others are here for the whole book which has taught me a lot."

I hope you read through this section and were possibly inspired to create a resolution for this year or the upcoming year. Happy 2025!

![January Study Tips 2025](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec6f1b35-e9d5-4ed7-8354-c81946d1ea74)

Studying can sometimes feel challenging, but having the right strategies can make it seem less overwhelming. Whether you’re looking to stay organized, improve on your focus, or make your studying more productive, we’ve decided to put together some study tips to help you! 

**˗ˏˋRemoving distractions: ´ˎ˗**

- Removing distractions can be an essential study tip because it helps you focus and concentrate more. When you remove any distractions, such as your phone or any background noise, you can pay more attention to your work. This means you should also find a place where you will have no distractions around you, such as the library! It makes it easier to concentrate, understand, and remember what you're studying for, which can make your studying time more efficient.

**˗ˏˋUsing extra homework/exams: ´ˎ˗**

- When it comes to finding other resources to help you study, using extra exams and homework can be beneficial! They give you more practice and help you get familiar with the concepts and types of questions you might be facing. Using extra exams or homework can also help you build confidence, improve your skills, and get used to different formats, so you're more prepared!

**- ˗ˏˋTaking break: ´ˎ˗**

- When working on an assignment for a long period of time without any breaks, it can make you feel stressed, overwhelmed, and lose your focus. That is why it is important for you to take short breaks every once in a while. By taking short breaks, you’re giving your mind a chance to rest, which can help you feel less stressed out and help you remember what you’re trying to study for!

**˗ˏˋStaying organized: ´ˎ˗**

- Another study tip that can help you study and be more organized with school, used to get a planner! A planner can help you have organized times of when you’re gonna study and do homework! I recommend getting a planner with something you like on it as it will make you want to use it more!

**˗ˏˋListening to music: ´ˎ˗**

- Something I recommend for studying is listening to music! Music is a common tool that is used to help many people in classrooms at home or anywhere to study and get things done! I always recommend listening to instrumental music as music with lyrics can get distracting when trying to study and focus on the assignment at hand!

**˗ˏˋChewing gum: ´ˎ˗**

- One thing I would love to have one studying is gum! I think gum is a really good tool and can help relieve a lot of stress! I was recommending sugar-free gum, but really any gum works! Gum is found to improve attentiveness, and help you be more focused and alert! It can also help to wake your brain up and help with cognitive Processes.
