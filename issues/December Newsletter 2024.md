![Teethyz Themed Christmas Story](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8e2a11e-8dcf-4670-b8e5-63054ebfeb26)

Hey Teethyz community! Today, I’ve written a perfectly merry story to bring us into the new year. I hope you enjoy!

———————————————————————————————————————

🌨️ The lull of the crisp, winter air delicately rushing past pine trees and houses gave the otherwise snowy expanse of a village an unfamiliar calm, especially during this time of year.

Yet, despite this chilling weather, a dentist’s office sat right at the summit of a snow laden hill. To the village people, despite how out of place it felt, this very office was the heart of christmas cheer in this little village.

Each and every year without fail, Dr. Nicholas decked this little building out with glimmering Christmas lights and a spectacle of decorations. The light these magical displays gave off couldn’t compare to how his christmas cheer lit up the village and made the season feel all the more cozier.

On an especially wintry Christmas, though, the village was hit by a frenzied blizzard. When it became almost too dangerous to step outside, it just so happened that Dr. Nicholas was hosting his annual Christmas party.

Everybody sat by the door, dumbfounded by the chaos. Their bundled up snowmen and Christmas lights had all been torn apart, leaving the outside looking more like the cave of a monster.

———————————————————————————————————————

**🦷 “Okay, everybody, just stay calm. It’s gonna be fine, I’m sure it’ll pass in no time!”**

Dr. Nicholas paced around his office, trying to bring some hope to this cheerful room turned bleak. Just as he finished his statement, the centerpiece of the decor, a towering snowman inflatable, had an icicle pierce through its thin polyester exterior. As he turned around to look, it simply detached from the ground and sadly flew away. It wasn’t the beacon of hope he was looking for, but he could spin this into something merry!

**🤦‍♀️ “Nick, I love you, I really do, but this is crisis mode! We can’t just grin and hope for the best. There’s some serious considerations we need to make here.”**

The clearly exasperated woman sat on a chair wrapped in green and red garland, placing her hands against her temples. Just as she looked back at Dr. Nicholas, he was standing in the center of the room holding a bucket of candy canes, grinning sheepishly. The littler ones ran up to him, giggling and taking their fair share entirely oblivious of the chaos happening around them. The adults, on the other hand, simply sat there taking in the situation.

**🦷 “It’s fine! It’s— we’re all fine. We don’t need to think about it. Can’t we just be a little merry for now? We still have to bob for apples! Finish up the snowball corn hole competition! Oh, and what about the elf hunt?! We CANNOT forget-”**

His sentence was abruptly cut off by a teenage girl, known for her hand-crocheted stockings, chiming in with an idea.

**☃️ “Nobody’s saying we can’t do that stuff in here.. where it’s safe. Maybe we don’t have everything we need, but we can improvise.”**

Standing up, she’d walk over to the bucket of complementary snowman shaped toothbrushes, picking one up and walking back over to address the panicked crowd.

**☃️ “We don’t have the elves anymore.. the wind probably took them.. but we have these toothbrushes! They’re just as merry, I’m sure they’ll work.”**

She’d pick up the rest of the toothbrushes and walked off to hide them. Dr. Nicholas reached a hand out to stop her, but had lost just enough hope in the situation to give up on this idea.

**🦷 “I think that’s a great idea… don’t we all?”**

He’d smile for a while, to the point where it got so awkward that the remaining people in the room just nodded in agreement. He’d walk off, the jingle bells on his sweater ringing and making it very clear where he was at any given moment.

——————————————————————————————————————— 

Together, the dentist and the girl teamed up to find a creative solution to all of their plans that were now buried in snow. Be it substituting snowballs for balls of gauze or switching out the apples for.. even more apples (How can a dentist be a dentist without apples?)

After a while, everybody was smiling and chatting once again. A big crowd was gathered around the corn hole tournament, cheering and booing at every turn. Children ran around the building searching for toothbrushes. The atmosphere had gone from gloomy to cheerful, and all it took were some creative ideas and a few snowman toothbrushes.

Heyhey! In this section, **Isabella (flowersandrainbowzz)** and **Emma (lvnderhqze)** interviewed a few people about their Christmas traditions. Now we want to hear from you! What are your Christmas traditions? Feel free to ping us in a chat if you'd like to share. Without further ado, let’s dive into the interviews!


*•˙˚∘ Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz*

*Interviewee: oceavnz*


ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: We started to stay home more, kinda just have fun and not really do much. Just play games and stuff.

ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: Every Christmas we eat dinner and do some activities, and some family comes to see us.


*•˙˚∘ Interviewer: lvnderhqze*

*Interviewee: tomxqv*


ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: Well, we all used to go on vacation together but during and from COVID, we haven't really been able to since.

ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: We go to my dad's sister's house after Christmas dinner to celebrate with a party. We usually unintentionally sleep over until the next morning and it's really fun since I'm with my cousins.

*Interviewee: laufcyy*

‌‌
ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: I used to spend Christmas at my father's apartment since he made really good food, and we didn't want him to miss out on it, but that unfortunately stopped since he has been busy with work. Something that definitely changed is our family, since it has grown more, and we usually try to spend time with our friends too if it's possible, which changes every year.

ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: On Christmas Eve, we start with dinner, then snacks and a film. On Christmas, we decorate the Christmas tree more and usually go somewhere fun. When we come back, we make DIY ornaments as a gift to an anonymous person, which ends up with drama most of the time, but that makes it more fun in my opinion.


*•˙˚∘ Interviewer: lvnderhqze*
  
*Interviewee: lvauraas*


ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: It hasn’t really changed, we have developed some traditions which we’ve done annually since I was little, for example having a takeaway every Christmas Eve!

ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: Every Christmas we do our traditions, then on actual Christmas Day, our family will come round and we will have a Christmas dinner and play board games and then the following day my family goes to my auntie and uncles house and we have sort of a second Christmas Day! It’s lots of fun!


*•˙˚∘ Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz*

*Interviewee: vawerwii*


ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: My family used to watch Christmas lighting ceremonies, and now we do our own! We also have an aunt's baking contest for the dessert in Christmas dinner each year, a tradition my dad's side of the family has been partaking in since before I was born.

ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: Every Christmas, we make chocolate chip cookies and peppermint bark for Santa. We also leave out carrots for the reindeer. After Christmas morning, we go over to my grandparents' house for dinner and host the dessert baking competition. We usually stay there for about 3 days with all of my cousins and it's awesome!


*•˙˚∘ Interviewer: lvnderhqze*
  
*Interviewee: evwrmores*


ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: Our Christmases don’t change too much! Our family typically sticks to the same routine.

ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: For us, Christmas starts on Christmas Eve. Every Christmas Eve, we go to my aunt's house and all of the cousins get matching pjs.

Christmas is always a big event for our family and a great way for us all to bond.

₊ ⊹ Hello everyone! I hope you’re enjoying the newsletter so far! Winter break is the perfect opportunity to try something new, relax, or embrace the magic of the season. In this section, we’ve put together some fun and exciting ideas, along with great reasons to give them a try, to help you make the most of your time off. Enjoy! 

*𐙚 Holiday Movie Marathon*

- With all the extra time during the holidays, why not dive into a holiday movie marathon? It’s the perfect chance to cozy up and revisit some of your favorite Christmas and holiday classics. Whether it’s the nostalgia of beloved childhood favorites or discovering a new festive movies that you can revisit next year, watching holiday movies is a great way to relax, spark joy, and fully embrace the season’s spirit. That’s what makes it such a fantastic winter break activity! ᝰ

*𐙚 Christmas Baking*

- Another one of my favorite activities during the winter is baking! Baking is a fun activity where you make sweet treats at home! During Christmas, there are so many different holiday treats you can make to enjoy over the break! Some of my favorites treats to make are sugar cookies, and additionally I enjoy making/decorating gingerbread houses! Hopefully this winter you will be able to enjoy one of these activities! ᝰ

*𐙚 Build a Snowman*

- A fun event that is perfect for the holidays and winter is building a snowman! You can use things that you have in your house to make a perfect snowman! When it is a snowy day, grab a carrot, something for the bottoms, and some clothes (like a scarf and a hat)! After that make three balls of snow all different sizes! Your biggest one the bottom and continue biggest to smallest! After that add your clothes and carrot! You now have a snowman! ᝰ

*𐙚 Snow Sports*

- Snow sports like skating, skiing, snowboarding, and sledding are the perfect way to make the most of the winter season during your break. These activities offer a fun mix of adventure, exercise, and fresh air, all while embracing the beauty of the snowy outdoors. Whether you’re gliding across the ice, carving down a slope, or racing a sled with friends, snow sports create unforgettable memories and a great way to stay active during the holidays, as well as for many places it’s the only time of year you can! So best to take advantage of it while you still can, I know I will be! ᝰ

⤷ We hope these ideas inspire you to make the most of your winter break! Whether you’re staying cozy indoors or heading out to embrace the winter wonderland, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Have a wonderful break! ♡

︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵﹒︵

**Question: What are your New Year’s resolutions?**

*Interviewee: stargvrlavie*

- ‌Answer: My New Year’s resolution is to be kinder to others because small acts of kindness can make a big difference. I wanna spread positivity and make people feel valued and cared for. 🤍

—————————————————————

*Interviewee: thiislqve*

- Answer: My New Year’s resolutions would definitely be to take advantage of all opportunities given to me, as you only live once!! Another one of my resolutions for the New Year would be to maintain a better sleep schedule!

—————————————————————

*Interviewee: tacsi52*

- Answer: I have a few resolutions I wanna do once the New Year comes. I want to get my productivity higher because I’m really not the most productive person ever, and yes I do get the urge to be so productive, but that lasts for like a day or two. I also want to get even more kind because I love being so and I think that everyone deserves someone to be kind to them! Last thing I wanna do is to fix my sleep schedule since it’s not the best, and I have to wake up early for school so I gotta fix that.

—————————————————————

*Interviewee: shallotatnight*
‌
- Answer: I want to cure cancer and get my bachelor’s degree in doctoring at Harvard or become Sabrina Carpenter.

- Answer: Help others as much as I can.

—————————————————————

*Interviewee: iietogzirls*

- Answer: Hi! So my New Year’s resolution for 2025 is to drink more water and eat less sugary food! I really want my skin to improve and my health overall, and I feel like I'll be able to do that if I stick to my goal! Tbh, I don't think I will because my mum keeps buying sweets for my brothers and I love ice cream 😣, but I guess that's just because I'm a fattie!!

—————————————————————

*Interviewee: lukefromthedead*

- Answer: Some of my New Year’s resolutions would have to be making more time for my mates, taking some time to chill, and finish my A-levels with some legendary results. 🔥

Hey Teethyz! I'm so glad to see you reading this month's newsletter, especially this section! It's always good to be mindful of the things that are happening in the world around us, so here is this month's awareness section! I encourage you all to read this part and share this information with your friends and family! Getting the word out will spread lots more awareness. Without further ado, here is the awareness section for December, I hope you enjoy!

**⤹  : Christmas!**

Christmas is celebrated on December 25th, and marks the birth of Jesus Christ in the Christian religion. This date is very important to Christians worldwide, which is why it is such a famous holiday. Christmas symbolizes hope, generosity and brings the world together as a whole! It is observed with religious services like gift-giving, festive decorations (lights, Christmas trees) and great meals!

**⤹  : Hanukkah!**

Hanukkah, otherwise known as the 'Festival of Lights' is an eight-day Jewish holiday commemorating the rededication of the second Jewish temple in Jerusalem! It honors the miracle in which a small bit of oil (enough for practically only a day) burned eight days straight in the temple's menorah! This holiday can be observed by lighting a menorah each night, playing dreidel games and eating yummy food!

**⤹  : Kwanzaa!**

Kwanzaa is a week long celebration honoring African Heritage. It is centered around seven principles known as the Nguzo Saba which include unity, self-determination, and collective work. Traditions include lighting the kinara (candleholder), sharing stories, music, and a feast called the Karamu on December 31. Kwanzaa celebrates cultural pride, community, and shared values among people of African descent.

Q3: Do you have any goals for your future Teethyz journey?

︶・︶・︶・︶

*Interviewer: frnkoceean*

*Interviewee: bouuqets*

- A1: I was so happy, I was extremely shocked as at first I didn’t think it was me.

- A2: Always work hard and don’t try to “fit in” with others, but don’t overwork yourself. “You can do anything you believe you can do.”

- A3: I hope to achieve higher roles and become like others. I hope to push myself to be the best that I can be.

︶・︶・︶・︶

*Interviewer: frnkoceean*

*Interviewee: Lilly_25200*

- A1: I was honestly so shocked! I just woke up and saw so many notifications then realized I got LROTW and was filled with joy!

- A2: Be as active as possible! Even 10 minutes in the game can make an impact and heighten your chances! A negative mind will not get you there, believe in yourself.

- A3: My main goal is definitely to get MI (Management Intern) or pass TSA (Trial Staff Assistant) and become an MR but also to make people feel welcome into the community.

*Interviewer: frnkoceean*

*Interviewee: jcyIaa*

- A1: I was so shocked. I got so scared when Lily pinged me. I was like “omg did I do something?” But honestly, I couldn't be any happier and I'm so so so grateful for getting LROTW.

- A2: Honestly, I don't have any advice I could share, cause I didn’t expect to get LROTW! But if I have to share something, I'd probably say, be active on Discord. Chat with your friends etc. Being in-game is also advice I'd say! But, don't overwork yourself! Fifteen minutes each day is ENOUGH!

- A3: Yes, I do actually! I would love to try and make another comeback. I miss being an MR. I would also love to make new friends and a lot of memories!

*Interviewer: frnkoceean*

*Interviewee: NovaXPro160*

- A1: I was so surprised. To be honest, I wasn’t expecting it.

- A2: Be you! Don't fret if you don’t win one week, you can always try another week. For example, I waited for 2 weeks, and I got it on the third one!

- A3: Yes, I would like to reach beyond my boundaries, and discover many things that are yet to be discovered!

**♡ 🎄﹕ MROTM Interview**

*Interviewer: frnkoceean*

*Interviewee: vcrsity*

Q1: What was your reaction to receiving MROTM?

- A1: When I got MROTM my jaw instantly dropped, I had no thought that I would someday get it and when I did I was stunned. I was goofing around at McRonalds just trying to pass the time when my pings started to flood and direct messages were coming in red hot so obviously I got confused and went and checked it all out, and turns out I got MROTM!! Safe to say I was shaking and pretty stunned for the rest of the hour still in shock that I had even got it. I also had a smile that did not go away for the whole night, I was that happy.

Q2: What advice would you share to LRs who would like to become MRs in the future?

- A2: Be unique, the key to standing out and being better than others is simply to be unique. If you think of it as an audition to become the lead singer for a band, they are going to be looking for a unique person with a fresh skill set who stands out from everyone else. Now coming from me, I know that you can do it, one quote I have always stuck to my whole life is "If someone else can do it, then so can I" which motivates me to go for it, and motivated me to keep driving to get MR and it worked. If you are truly dedicated and committed to reaching something or getting something, then I'm more than certain that you have what it takes to get that goal, and I will always believe in you guys to one day make it to where I am now, and I hope that in the future I see some of you awesome people in my position and enjoy it as much as I do.

Q3: Do you have any goals for your future journey as a MR?

- A3: My only goal is to make sure that people have fun here. I wouldn't ask for much else as the position that I am in now is what I need to make sure people enjoy their experience at Teethyz. This goal is already happening, however I want it to work on a larger scale. I want Teethyz to be a place where people can join to cheer up and have some fun and perhaps make some new friends, I love happiness and especially seeing other people happy is the best. I already do this with my shifts, by making them super interactable and fun for everyone no matter your rank. However now that I think of it, another goal would be to be a good role model for the community and help them to make their dreams come true, which I will try my best to do no matter what.

**♡ 🎄﹕ HROTM Interview**

*Interviewer: frnkoceean*

*Interviewee: kkennedys*

Q1: What was your reaction to receiving HROTM?

- A1: I was shocked. I didn't expect it at all. I was very happy to see that I got it as well!

Q2: What advice would you share to people who would like to become HROTM in the future?

- A2: The advice I would share with people is definitely to work your hardest and push your limits!

Q3: What has been the best part of your Teethyz journey so far?

- A3: The best part of my Teethyz Journey so far has been becoming a part of the Recruitment team. The Recruitment team is such a fun and unique team and there is so much that comes from it. Everyone is so great at what they do and I have so much fun.

**♡ 🎄﹕ Alliance Interview — Pastriez**

*Interviewer: frnkoceean*

*Interviewee: RblxPenguinn*

Q1: What is it like to be working in Pastriez's Public Relations Department?

- A1: Working in Pastriez's Communications Department is very fascinating and engaging! You often work on a variety of tasks and ensure that events meet the highest standards. Creativity and engagement are key factors in everything we do when hosting events. We often collaborate with others and always make sure that our community and alliances are satisfied with the results! 

Q2: What is it like working with Teethyz as an alliance?

- A2: Teethyz is a great alliance to work with! We appreciate all the collaborative events we've hosted with them, and the community has been supportive. We've made so many memories together, and we can't thank everyone enough for all the dedication put into these collaborative events. We also want to thank Teethyz for all their support, and we can't wait to grow our partnership further with more fun events in the future. 

Q3: What is your favorite memory during your time in PR?

- A3: My favorite memory during my time in the Communications Department has to be the unique events! I enjoy seeing everyone engage in them and always working together as a team. I love seeing people support each other and make new friends along the way. It allows you to connect with others and creates a positive atmosphere when hosting these events.
