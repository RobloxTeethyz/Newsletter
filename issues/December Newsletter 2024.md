*•˙˚∘ Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz*

*Interviewee: oceavnz*


  ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: We started to stay home more, kinda just have fun and not really do much. Just play games and stuff.

 ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: Every Christmas we eat dinner and do some activities, and some family comes to see us.

  ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: Well, we all used to go on vacation together but during and from COVID, we haven't really been able to since.

 ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: We go to my dad's sister's house after Christmas dinner to celebrate with a party. We usually unintentionally sleep over until the next morning and it's really fun since I'm with my cousins.

‌‌
  ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: I used to spend Christmas at my father's apartment since he made really good food, and we didn't want him to miss out on it, but that unfortunately stopped since he has been busy with work. Something that definitely changed is our family, since it has grown more, and we usually try to spend time with our friends too if it's possible, which changes every year.

 ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: On Christmas Eve, we start with dinner, then snacks and a film. On Christmas, we decorate the Christmas tree more and usually go somewhere fun. When we come back, we make DIY ornaments as a gift to an anonymous person, which ends up with drama most of the time, but that makes it more fun in my opinion.

*Interviewee: lvauraas*


  ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: It hasn’t really changed, we have developed some traditions which we’ve done annually since I was little, for example having a takeaway every Christmas Eve!

 ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: Every Christmas we do our traditions, then on actual Christmas Day, our family will come round and we will have a Christmas dinner and play board games and then the following day my family goes to my auntie and uncles house and we have sort of a second Christmas Day! It’s lots of fun!


*•˙˚∘ Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz*

*Interviewee: vawerwii*


  ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: My family used to watch Christmas lighting ceremonies, and now we do our own! We also have an aunt's baking contest for the dessert in Christmas dinner each year, a tradition my dad's side of the family has been partaking in since before I was born.

 ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: Every Christmas, we make chocolate chip cookies and peppermint bark for Santa. We also leave out carrots for the reindeer. After Christmas morning, we go over to my grandparents' house for dinner and host the dessert baking competition. We usually stay there for about 3 days with all of my cousins and it's awesome!

  ʚ Question: How has your family's way of celebrating Christmas changed over the years?

  - ʚ Answer: Our Christmases don’t change too much! Our family typically sticks to the same routine.

 ʚ Question: What do you and your family do every Christmas?

  - ʚ Answer: For us, Christmas starts on Christmas Eve. Every Christmas Eve, we go to my aunt's house and all of the cousins get matching pjs.

Christmas is always a big event for our family and a great way for us all to bond.

![Winter Break Activites](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e38b3d2-d781-4f10-aa3f-f0b8c0e927bf)

₊ ⊹ Hello everyone! I hope you’re enjoying the newsletter so far! Winter break is the perfect opportunity to try something new, relax, or embrace the magic of the season. In this section, we’ve put together some fun and exciting ideas, along with great reasons to give them a try, to help you make the most of your time off. Enjoy! 

*𐙚 Holiday Movie Marathon*

- With all the extra time during the holidays, why not dive into a holiday movie marathon? It’s the perfect chance to cozy up and revisit some of your favorite Christmas and holiday classics. Whether it’s the nostalgia of beloved childhood favorites or discovering a new festive movies that you can revisit next year, watching holiday movies is a great way to relax, spark joy, and fully embrace the season’s spirit. That’s what makes it such a fantastic winter break activity! ᝰ

*𐙚 Christmas Baking*

- Another one of my favorite activities during the winter is baking! Baking is a fun activity where you make sweet treats at home! During Christmas, there are so many different holiday treats you can make to enjoy over the break! Some of my favorites treats to make are sugar cookies, and additionally I enjoy making/decorating gingerbread houses! Hopefully this winter you will be able to enjoy one of these activities! ᝰ

*𐙚 Build a Snowman*

- A fun event that is perfect for the holidays and winter is building a snowman! You can use things that you have in your house to make a perfect snowman! When it is a snowy day, grab a carrot, something for the bottoms, and some clothes (like a scarf and a hat)! After that make three balls of snow all different sizes! Your biggest one the bottom and continue biggest to smallest! After that add your clothes and carrot! You now have a snowman! ᝰ

*𐙚 Snow Sports*

- Snow sports like skating, skiing, snowboarding, and sledding are the perfect way to make the most of the winter season during your break. These activities offer a fun mix of adventure, exercise, and fresh air, all while embracing the beauty of the snowy outdoors. Whether you’re gliding across the ice, carving down a slope, or racing a sled with friends, snow sports create unforgettable memories and a great way to stay active during the holidays, as well as for many places it’s the only time of year you can! So best to take advantage of it while you still can, I know I will be! ᝰ

⤷ We hope these ideas inspire you to make the most of your winter break! Whether you’re staying cozy indoors or heading out to embrace the winter wonderland, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Have a wonderful break! ♡

I want to get my productivity higher because I’m really not the most productive person ever, and yes I do get the urge to be so productive, but that lasts for like a day or two. I also want to get even more kind because I love being so and I think that everyone deserves someone to be kind to them!
