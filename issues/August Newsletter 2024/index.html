Here are some of the highlights from the Games, which took place from July 26 to August 11, 2024.</p><p>₊˚ ‿︵‿︵‿︵୨୧ · · ✦ · · ୨୧‿︵‿︵‿︵ ˚₊</p><p>-ˋˏ✄ <strong>Simone Biles&#x27; Triumphant Return</strong></p><ul><li>One of the standout stories was Simone Biles, who made a stunning comeback after withdrawing from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. In Paris, she secured three gold medals and one silver, leading the U.S. women&#x27;s gymnastics team to victory. Her golds came in the all-around and vault events, while she earned silver in the floor exercise. This performance marked a significant chapter in her career, bringing her total Olympic medals to seven golds, two silvers, and two bronzes across three Games.</li></ul><p>୭୧₊˚⊹︰<strong>Swimming Stars Shine</strong></p><ul><li>Katie Ledecky continued to cement her legacy in swimming, adding four more medals to her collection, including her fourth consecutive gold in the 800m freestyle.

Meanwhile, Summer McIntosh of Canada emerged as a new star, winning three golds and one silver, making her the first Canadian to win three gold medals in a single Olympic Games.</li></ul><p>・゜-: ✧ :- <strong>Sprinting Sensations</strong></p><ul><li>In athletics, Noah Lyles captured the spotlight with a sensational performance in the men&#x27;s 100m final, and an impressive performance in the men&#x27;s 200m final, securing bronze even with an illness.    Gabby Thomas played a crucial role in the U.S. women&#x27;s 4x100m relay team, helping them defend their gold medal. The relay showcased a thrilling comeback, with Thomas handing off to  Sha&#x27;Carri Richardson, who sprinted to victory.</li></ul><p>﹒✎゛𓂅 <strong>Suring Spectacle</strong></p><ul><li>Surfing made a significant impact at the Games, particularly during a memorable day at Teahupo&#x27;o in Tahiti. The men&#x27;s competition featured massive waves, with Brazilian surfer Gabriel Medina earning a near-perfect score of 9.90 for his performance. The image of the surfer striking a pose after riding a wave at the Games quickly made internet stars out of him and the photographer who captured it.</li></ul><p>꒰ ᐡ ´͈ ᐜ <strong>Basketball Showdowns</strong></p><ul><li>The basketball finals were a highlight of the Games, with the U.S. men&#x27;s team defeating the host nation France 98-87.

Nyjah Huston of the United States won gold in the men&#x27;s street event, while Momiji Nishiya of Japan defended her title from Tokyo 2020 in the women&#x27;s street competition. The sport&#x27;s inclusion in the Olympics has helped to showcase its growing popularity and the incredible skill of its athletes.</li></ul><p>᧔𓈒༷♪˚.᧓ <strong>Equestrian Excellence</strong></p><ul><li>Outstanding performances marked the equestrian events at the Paris Olympics.   Charlotte Dujardin of Great Britain made history by becoming the first rider to win individual gold medals in three consecutive Olympics, cementing her status as one of the greatest dressage riders of all time. The team competition was also thrilling, with Germany narrowly edging out the Netherlands for the gold medal.</li></ul><p>₊˚୭ ॱ˖ <strong>Closing Ceremony</strong> </p><ul><li>The Games concluded with a star-studded closing ceremony at the Stade de France, signaling the transition to the next Summer Olympics, set to take place in Los Angeles in 2028. The ceremony began with a prelude at the Tuileries Garden and included remarks from IOC President Thomas Bach and French President Emmanuel Macron, followed by the traditional handover of the Olympic flag to Los Angeles, the host city for the 2028 Summer Olympics. The event was highlighted by star-studded performances from Tom Cruise, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, and Snoop Dogg, who captivated the audience with their unique styles and energy, creating an unforgettable atmosphere that celebrated not just athletic achievements, but also the cultural significance of the Olympics. The closing ceremony left a lasting impression as the world looks forward to the next Olympic adventure in Los Angeles. </li></ul><p>ᗢ𓄹 ׅ ࣪ ˖︶꒷꒦⊹˚Ꮚ₊꒷︶꒷⊹˚Ꮺ</p><ul><li><p>In conclusion, the Paris 2024 Olympics not only showcased extraordinary athletic performances, but also celebrated the spirit of unity and cultural diversity that the Games embody.

I have reallyyy random boxes, so I can&#x27;t really recommend any.</p><p>🎉 #4 - Extras: Some extra things that I carry with myself are gum, hair ties, a mini makeup bag, and a mini hair brush. Then, of course, my keys, wallet, and my phone. I try not to carry much with me. </p><p>💻 #5 - Devices: If you have a school laptop or a tablet, bring that too. I don&#x27;t have anything like that as our teachers always bring them to classes!</p><p>📒 #6 - Notebooks: Almost forgot to mention, buy new notebooks!

Despite this name getting eerily close to turning into a tongue twister, its sleek design and vibrant colors are quite deserving of such a lengthy name! The Uni Propus Window Highlighters offer mini plastic windows in their slim chisel tips which make it incredibly easy to highlight your notes or annotate a captivating novel without fail! It has an easy to grasp design which makes it the perfect pencil case favorite for long note taking days.</p><p>📏 #4 - Midori Multi Ruler:
This tool, from its genius design to its measuring capabilities, is pure perfection in a ruler! As somebody who has their pencil case stuffed full of pens and pencils, it’s a struggle to even fit in a sticker sheet. This ruler fixes my problem! The Midori Multi Ruler made the genius design choice to make their ruler foldable, making it a breeze to throw into a wallet or, in my case, a pencil case that’s far too full. It comes in 3 colors, being pink, blue, and the classic clear making this school day staple perfect for almost anybody!</p><p>🗒️ #5 - Paperian Planner Marker Mini Sticky Notes:
As someone who loves to annotate everything, I always keep a few of these on hand! These tiny sticky notes are absolutely perfect for last minute comments while note taking or reminders in your planner! While regular sticky notes are big and bulky, these come in tiny sheets of 20 sticky notes per color. These are definitely a luxury, but they’re so useful! I always keep a planner on hand, and it’s covered from head to toe in these sticky notes. I’m a forgetful person, so sometimes I write little reminders to myself or even just positive comments that bring a smile to my face when I’m feeling down!</p><p>📝 #6 - Sakura Arch Foam Eraser:
Last but not least, I can’t neglect to mention my favorite tiny but mighty eraser! I’ve used these for 2 years and they’ve outperformed any eraser that I’ve ever used. I can erase any mistakes that I make in just a few seconds with hardly any pencil marks remaining! This might be a more boring pick, but it’s one of my all time favorite stationery items! They come in two sizes, but I always make sure to get the small ones so I can bring them with me wherever I may be. It has an arched sleeve design, making it more durable and less sensitive to breaking! I’m constantly erasing things, especially as a writer and I couldn’t pick a better eraser to do the job!</p><p>𓂃 　౨ 𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟　　♡⠀ 　𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟𓎟 ৎ　𓂃</p><p>🏫: We hope that you guys enjoyed this section!

We also went to a magic show that I was involved in when I was a child. I went up on the stage as a kid so it brought back some memories!

My hard work had paid off, I&#x27;m proud of myself. &lt;3.</p><p>Q2: What advice would you share to LRs who would like to become LROTW in the future?</p><p>A2: Here is some advice I&#x27;d give to people trying to get LROTW in the future! Firstly, I know people who try playing for 5–10 hours a day, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s not worth it, nor is it healthy! I recommend playing for around 2–3 hours and shifting multiple times during those hours! Secondly, this is one of the best pieces of advice I&#x27;ve gotten. Which is focusing on your appointments. Trust me, you have nothing else to do but to make/do your appointments, so focus on them! Also, Be sure to interact with your clients and make them happy! Thirdly, I know using grammar is not a rule anymore, but I still would recommend using it since I think it&#x27;s professional. Fourthly, be careful and make sure you don&#x27;t get involved in such conversation and drama. Lastly, remember that good things happen at good times. Be patient, and LROTW is yours! DM me if you would like more advice!</p><p>Q3: How has your journey been at Teethyz so far?</p><p>A3: My Journey this past year at Teethyz has been amazing! Got my first HW award which made me so proud of myself and now LROTW?! During my journey, I made a huge amount of friends! I feel so lucky to have joined this amazing community with people I can enjoy with, I&#x27;m honoured.</p><p>—————————————————————</p><ul><li>Interviewer: Ioviinqbr</li><li>Interviewee: cxybrz</li></ul><p>Q1: How did you react when you first received LR of the week?</p><p>A1: I was honestly surprised and quite moved by this achievement. It is a great feeling to know that my hard work and dedication at Teethyz is being recognised, motivating me to keep working hard to fulfil my experience here at Teethyz.</p><p>Q2: What advice would you share to LRs who would like to become LROTW in the future?</p><p>A2: I think the best advice I can offer is to stay consistently active. It&#x27;s important to try to form friendships during your time here and to engage with the community by showing genuine interest in your work. I&#x27;d also like to encourage people to ask for feedback from the wonderful staff team, as they&#x27;re always willing to help.</p><p>Q3: How has your journey been at Teethyz so far?</p><p>A3: I have had a wonderful experience at Teethyz so far! I am really happy to be treated equally and as an individual within this community. It&#x27;s a great place to work for those who want to boost their confidence and build relationships with others.</p><p>. ੭  🧸  <em>MROTM Interview</em></p><ul><li>Interviewer: svphiees</li><li>Interviewee: AlfiundJo</li></ul><p>Q1: How did you react when you first received MR of the month?</p><p>A1: I was literally shocked because I didn&#x27;t expect it at all. I suddenly got a lot of pings but also DMs and then I saw that I became MROTM. It&#x27;s such an honor for me to be chosen for this. I am so incredibly grateful and appreciate it very much because it is definitely not a given.</p><p>Q2: What advice would you share to LRs who would like to become MRs in the future?</p><p>A2: I think the most important thing is to not give up. If you have goals then you definitely can achieve that. I know it’s not easy to become an MR but if you really want it, you can do that. Just try to be active at the dentist but also in the server. If you’re outstanding then someone will notice you. Keep in mind to not overwork yourself though, your health is always more important than everything else!</p><p>Q3: How has your journey been at Teethyz so far?</p><p>A3: My journey at Teethyz has been great so far, I&#x27;ve had so many experiences here and I&#x27;m really enjoying being here.
