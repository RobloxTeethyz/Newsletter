╭  ᡣ𐭩 ˚ **March Awarness!** ・₊ ⊹

・Hello everyone! During the month of March, there were multiple important events such as Women’s History Month, Ramadan, Saint Patrick’s Day, and Easter! Don’t know much about these topics? We’ve made a few descriptions explaining the importance of each one of these subjects.


╭  ᡣ𐭩 ˚ **Ramadan!** ・₊ ⊹

・ Ramadan, in arabic رَمَضَان holds great significance as one of the most sacred months in the Islamic calendar. It serves as a time for Muslims to honor the revelation of the Quran (holy book of Islam) and engage in fasting from foods and drinks during daylight hours. This self-restraint has a deeper meaning, it strengthens their connection with God and fostering qualities like self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy towards those who are less fortunate. Not all muslims fast, certain individuals such as pregnant women, sick, elderly, and young children, are all excused from fasting. Ramadan Kareem to all participating!


╭  ᡣ𐭩 ˚ **Easter!** ・₊ ⊹

・ Easter is a special time that marks the beginning of spring. It is a celebration of new beginnings and the triumph of life over death. Easter has both religious and non-religious traditions. One of these traditions is the hiding and finding of colorful eggs, which symbolize life and rebirth. Families also come together to enjoy delicious meals and celebrate the awakening of nature. Happy Easter to all celebrating!


╭  ᡣ𐭩 ˚ **Women's History Month!**・₊ ⊹

International Women's History Month is a month not only meant to celebrate and acknowledge the accomplishments of all women who’ve positively impacted the feminist movement, such as Malala Yousafzai, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, but to also raise awareness for the mistreatment and sexism they’ve faced in hopes to someday live in a society where all humans are viewed as equals, regardless of gender. We also celebrated International Women’s Day on March 8th, which truly focused on emphasizing the importance of what Women's History Month strives to achieve. I hope you took a moment to recognize female role models in your life. Let's remember the names of the women who have paved the way for us all!


╭  ᡣ𐭩 ˚ **Saint Patrick's Day!** ・₊ ⊹

Saint Patrick's Day, although recognized internationally, is centered around Irish culture and is viewed by many as a religious holiday. It acknowledges the life of the Patron Saint of Ireland, who was credited for spreading the ideologies and beliefs of Christianity to the Irish people, despite having been enslaved by them prior. Families and communities from all nations of the world come together to celebrate on the 17th of March, typically with festivities and parades.

**March’s storybook**
Greetings everyone! For a tiny celebration of all of these holidays happening at the moment I sat myself down and found 2 adorable stories for you to read and enjoy. Feel free to read through the two stories I’ve set up below!



🐣 **Easter** 🐣 


Once upon a time, in a cozy burrow beneath a tall oak tree, lived a fluffy bunny named Benny. Benny wasn't just any bunny – he was the Easter Bunny! Every year, Benny would hop through meadows and forests, spreading joy by hiding colorful eggs for children to find on Easter morning.
One sunny day, as Benny was preparing for his big Easter adventure, he noticed a little duckling named Daisy who looked sad because she couldn't find her way home. With a hop and a skip, Benny offered to help Daisy find her family.
Together, they journeyed across fields and streams, hopping and waddling along until they found Daisy's family waiting by a sparkling pond. Daisy's family was overjoyed to see her, and they thanked Benny with smiles and quacks.
From that day on, Daisy and Benny became the best of friends, and every Easter, they worked together to make the world a brighter and happier place. And as the children searched for eggs hidden by Benny, they knew that Easter was not just about candy and treats, but about friendship and kindness too.



 🍀 **St. Patrick’s Day** 🍀 

 
Once upon a time in a charming Irish village, there lived a mischievous leprechaun who goes by the name, Liam. Liam loved St. Patrick's Day more than anything because it was his chance to spread joy and laughter to everyone he met!
On St. Patrick's Day morning, Liam woke up bright and early, ready to embark on his favorite holiday adventure. With a twinkle in his eye and a pot of gold at his side, Liam set off through the emerald hills, leaving behind tiny shamrocks and golden coins for children to find and be surprised. 
As the day went on, Liam danced a merry jig with friendly villagers, painted rainbows in the sky, and even helped a lost lamb find its way back to the flock, And though Liam was just a wee leprechaun, he knew that the true magic of St. Patrick's Day lay in bringing smiles to the faces of those around him. Even tricks!
And so, as the sun set over the Irish countryside, Liam returned to his cozy cottage, his heart overflowing with joy and gratitude for the magic of St. Patrick's Day. And as he drifted off to sleep, he knew that tomorrow would bring even more adventures and laughter for him and his friends.

Welcome back to the amazing Of The Month section! In this section, we have interviewed our Of The Months by a few questions, and now you can see their answers!


We will begin with our lovely MR Of The Month, **Maya, (mayawasbored)!** Maya is an Assistant Manager here at Teeth'yz, and we are happy to interview her today! 


--


**Interviewer: swocieties**


**Interviewee: Mayawasbored**

*What was your reaction to getting MR of the month?*



A) Honestly, very shocked. I definitely had other people in mind that I was confident would get it. I got quite sick during the end of the month so I wasn't very active as I normally am, so getting a role getting recognized for my hard work was honestly something unexpected. However, I was extremely happy and grateful that I was able to accomplish something like this! 🙂



*What’s some advice you would give to LR’s trying to be an MR one day?*



A) Expect the unexpected and never give up. There has been plenty of times during my LR life when I felt like I was unrecognized, unappreciated, and like I was wasting my time. That feeling is something I still experience today! You are appreciated and recognized, trust me. All the work that you do truly is appreciated and if you keep going you WILL get there eventually. I can with my full confidence tell you that working consistently without overworking yourself is key. Who knows, what if the day you stop trying was when you were SOOO close to getting MR?! Expect the unexpected at all times and truly don’t take anything for granted. Enjoy the period of being an LR as it’s a valuable experience and be the very best version of yourself! ❤️



*What’s some advice you would give to MR’s trying to one day get MR of the month?*



A) Being active ISNT EVERYTHING! Please hear me out when I say that being active ISNT everything. Yes of course it has a role but please keep in mind that everything you do is appreciated and recognized. Prioritize going above and beyond with your service rather than trying to be as active in-game as possible. Both are factors, however, everything you do is recognized so always try to be your best version of yourself. DO NOT overwork yourself and work consistently NOT constantly. Take my words to heart, health comes first. Anything is truly possible if you try, never stop being you and ALWAYS state your opinions and concerns, people do care. ❤️



~_~ *Wow, that was a lot! Thank you so much, Maya. We are so happy that Maya is apart of our community!* ~_~ 



We will now move onto the HR Of The Month section, where we are going to interview **Kennedy, (kkennedys)!** Kennedy is an Executive Assistant here at Teeth'yz, let's let her shine!


--


**Interviewer: swocieties**


**Interviewee: kkennedys**


--


*What was your reaction to getting HR of the month?*



A) Okayy so! I was on my way home from hanging with my friends and then I checked discord and saw a bunch of notifications and saw I was congratulated for HROTM! I was very excited, grateful and surprised to hear that I got that award!



*What’s some advice you would give to LR’s trying to be an MR one day?*



A) One advice I would give the LR’s trying to be MRs one day is don’t lose hope! I know that sometimes it’s very difficult and stressful at times to keep going but, in the end it is all worth it! Keep working hard and make friends along the way who support you!



*What’s some advice you would give to HR’s trying to one day get HR of the month?*



A) Some advice I would give to the HRs trying to get HR of the month one day is don’t overwork yourselves. Stay your true self and speak your opinions in what you believe in!



Thank you so much for these amazing answers Kennedy! We have one last section to present to you, Alliance Of The Month. Our Alliance Of The Month for March was **Kohau**! 



Alright, yourfavasiian will be representing Kohau, and it's such a honor to be interviewing them today. Let's begin!

--


**Interviewer: tuIipvs**


**Interviewee: yourfavasiian**


--


*What is it like working with Teeth’yz from an alliance perspective?*



A) I think it’s great! Kohau has been partnered with Teethyz for an extremely long time now. It’s really exciting to see both communities grow and see where they are now!



*What's something you enjoy the most while working with Teeth’yz as an alliance?*



A) I actually love being able to preserve a close connection with a close friend I made during my time at here at Teethyz, Chrissy! Also, known as XxCandy2372xX. It’s amazing to know she’s thriving and doing so well! 



Thank you so much to Ambrielle (yourfavasiian) from Kohau for taking time out of their day to get interviewed! This is all for the March Of The Month section, congratulations to all of our Of The Months!
