    Hello, Teethyz! I hope you all had a great September, I sure did because I had the privilege of talking about & interviewing a couple of people on different 'Fall Songs' they have been listening to! September is widely recognized as a transition from summer to fall. So, Teethyz was interested in what people were listening to for the new season! All of these songs are amazing, and I recommend you all listen to at least a couple of them. Without further ado, here is what some of our management are listening to for the fall season! I first began with interviewing a couple of MR+!

Interviewer: fwoIklore
Interviewee: rvpwtation

Question: What are some songs you are listening to for the fall season?
Response: "A few songs that I will be listening to this fall include: 'Willow', 'Gold rush', 'Cowboy like me', and 'Long story short' by Taylor Swift, 'Calgary' and 'Plastic palm trees' by Tate McRae, and 'Let go' by Ark Patrol. I have a lot more but those are just a few! These are some of my favorite songs for the fall season as they give me that autumn feeling and allow me to picture leaves falling and that chilled weather, fall is one of my favorite seasons!"

Question: What are some songs you are listening to for the fall season?
Response: "One song I always love listening to during fall is 'Cardigan' by Taylor Swift! I remember I was really into this song last year around September and October, so now whenever I hear it I think of fall!"

Question: What are some songs you are listening to for the fall season?
Response: 'Chicago' by Louis Tomlinson!! And like the rest of his Faith in The Future album. It just kind of gives me fall vibes!! I love listening to it while walking home. I also went to the tour of that album last fall so that's probably why."

⤹  ⁝  Personally, I love listening to music. It is something that brings me comfort 24/7, and is always something I can look forward to whenever I am having a bad day or even a good day! So, here are some of my top picks for fall songs! Give them a listen or check them out on the Teethyz Fall Playlist!

・History Of Man - Maisie Peters
・The Alcott - The National & Taylor Swift

⤹  ⁝  In conclusion, music brings people together. Most, if not all, Teethyz members have some sort of connection towards music and it is important that we embrace that! It is scientifically proven that music helps mental health. With this change in seasons, it can be a big change but there is always something to guide you through hard times. For most, its music! I hope you enjoyed reading this section, I had a pleasure creating this for everyone to read. I hope the new season brings you joy! Make sure to read all the other sections in the newsletter aswell! Au revoir!
