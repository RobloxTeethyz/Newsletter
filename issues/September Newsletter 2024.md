Hello, Teethyz! I hope you all had a great September, I sure did because I had the privilege of talking about & interviewing a couple of people on different 'Fall Songs' they have been listening to! September is widely recognized as a transition from summer to fall. So, Teethyz was interested in what people were listening to for the new season! All of these songs are amazing, and I recommend you all listen to at least a couple of them. Without further ado, here is what some of our management are listening to for the fall season! I first began with interviewing a couple of MR+!

Interviewer: fwoIklore

Interviewee: rvpwtation

Question: What are some songs you are listening to for the fall season?

Response: "A few songs that I will be listening to this fall include: 'Willow', 'Gold rush', 'Cowboy like me', and 'Long story short' by Taylor Swift, 'Calgary' and 'Plastic palm trees' by Tate McRae, and 'Let go' by Ark Patrol. I have a lot more but those are just a few! These are some of my favorite songs for the fall season as they give me that autumn feeling and allow me to picture leaves falling and that chilled weather, fall is one of my favorite seasons!"

Interviewer: fwoIklore

Interviewee: mariesluvqs

Question: What are some songs you are listening to for the fall season?

Response: "One song I always love listening to during fall is 'Cardigan' by Taylor Swift! I remember I was really into this song last year around September and October, so now whenever I hear it I think of fall!"

Interviewer: fwoIklore

Interviewee: softleys

Question: What are some songs you are listening to for the fall season?

Response: 'Chicago' by Louis Tomlinson!! And like the rest of his Faith in The Future album. It just kind of gives me fall vibes!! I love listening to it while walking home. I also went to the tour of that album last fall so that's probably why."

⤹  ⁝  Personally, I love listening to music. It is something that brings me comfort 24/7, and is always something I can look forward to whenever I am having a bad day or even a good day!

It is scientifically proven that music helps mental health. With this change in seasons, it can be a big change but there is always something to guide you through hard times. For most, its music! I hope you enjoyed reading this section, I had a pleasure creating this for everyone to read. I hope the new season brings you joy! Make sure to read all the other sections in the newsletter aswell!

. ੭  🍓 __**The Weirdest Training of My Life**__

__Written By: stcrbwrries__

  Once when I was training, Aria and Joseph were hosting a session together! I expected it to be a normal training with all the normal things but Ryan joined! If you've ever been in-game with Ryan (J6V), you know something bizarre will happen! So we continued our training as normal and when it got to teleporting out trainees and saying the information, Ryan gave every MR a money bag which can give out fake money and we were allowed to use and the trainees tried getting all the money thinking it was Robux! Once I finished training, I headed back where everyone else was and there were a bunch more props there (like the classic Roblox sandwich, a potion and a disco ball) and everyone was getting it! When we were SUPPOSED to be doing the training pic, we were too busy playing around with cars and disco balls and Ryan made us all giants and flew us! In the end when we actually got the picture, we all somehow got btools and yeah !! That one training was finished after more than 1 chaotic hour!

. ੭  🪩 __**McDonald’s and Promotions**__

 __Written By: fwoIklore__

I have been associated with Teethyz since around 2021, but became a Management member in 2022. I was thrilled with this opportunity and was delighted I got to be promoted. Fast forward about 4 months later and I'm promoted to Supervisor! When I was promoted to that rank, I was at a McDonald’s with some friends. None of my friends know about Teethyz so I couldn't show my excitement. I was very thrilled to be promoted at my favorite place ever. 3 months later I sadly resigned, but then little over a year later I came back to Management! Nothing too special about this part but 4 months later, I’m at McDonald's with my dad and decide to go into Discord and I see staff chat blowing up. Apparently somebody was going to be promoted? I stayed to see who it would be when there was a giant promotion wave with my name on it!!! I was at McDonald's again promoted to Supervisor, AGAIN! I guess McDonald's has everything for a girl looking for some fries!

. ੭  ☁️  __**Quinn’s Journey at Teethyz**__

 __Written By: qurviq__

My story at Teethyz began June 19th when I joined the Discord server! I quickly climbed the ranks until I got Oral Surgeon! I met some great people that I loved talking to on the Discord server, such as Kayla, Bella, Leah, Caroline, and Madi! Then I one day got a notification that July TSA Applications came out. I shrugged my shoulders and thought “why not?” I knew I had less than slim chances passing applications, let alone passing trials, but I thought it might be a good experience for me. I quickly got to writing, and I submitted my application 3 days later. One morning I wake up and I see an abnormal amount of pings. I checked the passers, and apparently I passed my application! I thought “Great! I passed my application, but there’s no way I can pass trials, right?”… Well, if you happened to look at the July 2024 TSA passers… I passed! I was beyond ecstatic! Quick thank you to RBLXWithEmily, my mentor, and WhispTea, my fellow mentee. I’ve been a Staff Assistant at Teethyz since August 7, and I’m still going strong! 💪

. ੭  🪷  **__Kayla’s Friendship at Teethyz__**

 __Written By: kkvylas__

Hi! I will be telling you a story of how the start of me, Elsa (elsaisdute), and Amelia’s (Uhmeliaa) friendship began! At the time, I was a Dental Hygiene Specialist and saw they were on a call in the server! I decided to join since I didn’t have much to do. As soon as I joined, I realized that this was the start of a great friendship. Me, Elsa, and Amelia have seen each other grow in each others Teethyz journey. It is currently our four months as friends. We have been good friends and met others along the way! Till this day, I am very grateful for them and all my other friends! 🤍

. ੭ 😝 **__A Funny V2 Memory__** 

__Written By: S7icy__

In 2023, a funny Roblox glitch occurred in V2 where almost everyone’s avatar turned bald. Those wigs were snatched haha, and no one knew how. Many felt embarrassed by their shiny bald heads showing, while others couldn’t stop laughing. I remember teasing my friend, Im_Harv, asking him what shampoo he used. Later, we took a hilarious #Bald-Shift photo. During some braces appointments with clients, they kept asking me why they were bald. One even joked, "Am I getting my teeth fixed, or am I trying to grow my hair here?" Some clever people with (cape)  used the "hat ID" to add wigs, which was actually a smart move!

. ੭ 💗 **__Millie’s Journey at Teethyz__** 

__Written By: mvilliez__

My journey at Teethyz is a lot. First time I joined Teethyz was on Apr 13, 2020. I was so shocked at how nice Staffing was and it was really a nice experience. I worked there for about 1 year until I took a break. I think I started again in May, 2024, and I don't regret my choice. I made so many friends and I love Teethyz cause they make me feel like I'm loved and that I have friends. It means a lot to me that people are so caring and loving to everyone. When I open discord I go to Teethyz to type a message cause it's so fun to communicate and meet new people. I got OS 20 July and I'm trying to work up! Teethyz is like my other home and I just love being a part of the community. <3

. ੭ 👀 **__A Crazy Experience with Slender Avatars__** 

__Written By: stcrsets__

Okay so there was an increase in slender avatars at the back, as a back accessory. When they started being first made, I was in the dentist and I thought it was an exploiter. I spent over 30 minutes being chased by it, and it flew everywhere. I couldn't find the user, I was going insane!! I even have a photo of me staring at it. I eventually got so tired and it left, then a few hours later I saw it again, then realized it was a back accessory. When I found this out, a literal tear fell out of my eye!! I think about this everyday and I still don't know whether I should laugh or cry!

. ੭ 🔥 **__Luke’s Journey at Teethyz__** 

__Written By: lukefromthedead__

My journey at teethyz has been a long one. I have been around for 17 months so I'm not short on stories to tell. A key moment I remember from my journey at Teethyz was being promoted to Office Manager. I'd been in my rank for around 6 months and kept trying my best for it to pay off on Christmas Day with a promotion by the legend himself, Lyn. That was one of my most memorable moments because whenever someone isn't feeling motivated, I can use it as an example that good things come to those who wait.

Thank you so much for reading the short stories section of the September Newsletter! We hope you enjoyed it. 🤍
