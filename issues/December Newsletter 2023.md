❄️  Interviewer: avvieqs
🎅  Interviewee: iixtashaxii 
︽︽︽

A: So basically! My family does this thing called the ‘Mariah Showdown’ where you can’t listen to ‘All I want for Christmas is you’ by Mariah Carey and my whole family compete and we have a whole groupchat so my family all over the world can join ahah!

❄️  Interviewer: avvieqs
🎅  Interviewee: abbviys
︽︽︽

A: SOO every year for Christmas and new years my family does karaoke with our favourite songs, watches movies, fireworks, plays boardgames like monopoly and have this amazing roast dinner. It's not much but I enjoy it a lot and its my favourite time of the year!

❄️  Interviewer: avvieqs
🎅  Interviewee: lolcandy1457
︽︽︽

A: OK! So, a tradition my family and I have is that we always go full on out with Christmas decorations. We always hang our Christmas lights outside our house and decorate the tree all together. Lastly, I decorate gingerbread houses and make hot chocolate with my siblings. 🤍

❄️  Interviewer: avvieqs
🎅  Interviewee: choiisiiwon
︽︽︽

A: I would say staying up late after dinner to spend time together, open presents and caroling.

❄️  Interviewer: avvieqs
🎅  Interviewee: hclidays
︽︽︽

A: So around July, my family tends to make a huge huge dinner. Apparently it’s called the “July Feast” and my family from like Switzerland, Puerto Rico, and others places comes to my house, and we just feast and catch up with each other. The thing about the food is this it’s not from stores or anything.  It’s all homemade. It’s VERY delicious and if I could make it a thanksgiving part 2 I definitely would!

❄️  Interviewer: avvieqs
🎅  Interviewee: faiewes
︽︽︽

A: Well, I don't feel like it's too unique, but my cousins, brother and I have to lock ourselves up in the bathroom after dinner so that Santa can magically bring us our presents and put them under the Christmas tree.

❄️  Interviewer: avvieqs
🎅  Interviewee: snoopydesai
︽︽︽

A: We always travel to see our grandparents and it’s super fun!! I love seeing them and there is always LOADS of gifts.

☃ **Short Christmas stories**
        ╰ by bvcrls and vaemmlaqx 

Sadly, the holidays have come to an end but that doesn’t stop us from making some amazing MR+ themed Christmas stories! Enjoy reading 2 of our short Christmas stories! Let’s get into it.. 

❅› Once, on a late Christmas night, a group of little Elf On The Shelf’s stole Santa's cookies. These mischievous little elves' names were Julia, Kennedy and Anna! They would always cause a ruckus on Christmas Eve, but this year they went ballistic. These three mischievous elves were going to take Santa's cookies! Even Santa knew they took it too far, but little did they know, Santa had a plan. Santa was going to put hot sauce in these new cookies. Well, not Santa himself but one of his helpers. So, Santa told Vivi to place the cookies and replace them. When Julia, Kennedy and Anna thought they’d get freshly baked, sweet, delicious cookies, they got hot sauce cookies. Boy oh boy did they flip! They hid from Santa and were never seen again...

❅› Everybody knows Rudolph, but nobody knows the second most famous reindeer in the world: Ardil the Reindeer!
Santa Claus did not know what to do with Ardil. He did not like to be outside. He was too clumsy for the toy workshop. And, he would also eat everything he cooked in the kitchen.
At last, Santa realized that Ardil was always talking. Then, in a bright flash, he realized what Ardil could do. He could answer the phone! He was so happy that he finally had a purpose in the workshop. Everybody was constantly calling, and Ardil was the perfect pick for this role! Ardil became the happiest Reindeer in the world as he loved talking to friends, children or even Rudolph, on the phone.
There’s always something that you are good at. It might take some time to figure out, though.

✰ ~ In different parts of the world, there are many amazing traditions and recipes out there. Do you want to make something that is yummy this dinner and know about some holiday traditions around the world? Well, I will blast you with some delicious recipes and holiday traditions in this section. 

🇨🇴 **Columbia** 🇨🇴

One tradition in Columbia is the Christmas lights. It begins on December 7th with the celebration of Día de las Velitas (Candlelight Day). The streets are filled with colorful lights and candles to make wishes. 

A delicious Columbian dish you can make is the Ajiaco (Chicken and Potato Soup). The Ajiaco includes vegetables, spices, chicken, herbs, and served with capers and cream. 

🇩🇪 **Germany** 🇩🇪

This country is covered in colorful lights and decorations this time of month. There is a lot of warm foods and festive spirit in Germany. Many brands in Germany create calendars where numbered paper “doors” are opened to reveal a gift of a sweet, a treat, or a toy (advent calendars). There are many things included in advent calendars, and they’re really fun to open up and see what you’re gonna get for each day. 

One yummy German recipe is the German Potato Pancakes (Reibekuchen). They are made with raw potatoes. You need to grate the potatoes and onion, add some more ingredients, and the fry it. You can either make them sweet or savory. 

🇳🇴 **Norway** 🇳🇴

Holiday traditions in Norway begin early on, typically the last weekend in November. Some things that they do are bake Christmas cookies, buy gifts, and going to a cheerful concert.

A tasty recipe in Norway is Fårikål. It is a Norwegian Lamb & Cabbage Stew. You need to put cabbage and lamb and let it simmer for a few hours. People commonly eat it with potatoes.
