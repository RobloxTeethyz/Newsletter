World Autism Awareness Month offers a dedicated period each year to shed light on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and promote understanding, acceptance and inclusion globally. Throughout the month, organisations, communities and individuals come together to raise awareness through educational events, campaigns and initiatives. It's a time to celebrate and understand the unique strengths and perspectives of individuals with autism while also advocating for access to support services, employment opportunities, and inclusive environments.

╭ ˚﹒୨ৎ **APRIL FOOLS DAY** ﹒⚝


︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵ ﹒︵


✿ ˚ .  Greetings, Teethyz community! April has many wonderful celebrations, and April Fools' is one of them! It's a time when everyone enjoys joking around with friends and setting up pranks for a good laugh! If you would like to know what it is, and the origin of it, read on! 



୨﹒April Fools' Day is a day full of many pranks, playful jokes, and humorous hoaxes celebrated on April 1st every year! The main focus is to try to trick the people around you and have fun with your friends, family or even the wider community! It has been celebrated for many, many years and all of us love to experience a day full of joy and laughter!



How did April Fools' Day start? Well, the exact origins of it are quite uncertain - as it has evolved over many centuries! However, there is a theory that traces back to the 16th century in Europe - when the Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar. This is when New Year has been moved from April 1st to January 1st! Many people did not approve of the new date, or were unaware of the change and continued to celebrate the new year during the last week of March throughout April 1st. The individuals were becoming the main targets of jokes, pranks and hoaxes by those who got used to the new calendar, starting a brand new tradition: April Fools' Day!



Over time, April Fools' has spread throughout Europe and eventually across the globe, evolving into a fun celebration where you can joke around and have fun! ˚   ۪    ⋆

 ʚ **Answer:** I was somewhat close to the solar eclipse to the point where I saw the sun about halfway covered. I would have definitely driven to go see it, but I didn’t get the chance to.

 ʚ **Question:** If you saw it, or if you didn't. Was the solar eclipse near you or did you have to drive further away to see it?

 
 ʚ **Answer:** I saw it, but it was cloudy that day! The sun was 100% covered in my area though, so I didn’t have to drive far away to see it. It was an amazing experience, and I would love to see it again!

Hello Teethyzians! Today we have the pleasure to present you our OTM interviews! This section consists of interviews that took place with our MR/HR/Alliance OTM! Without further ado, we present to you the interviews!



**Interviewer:** Furnface


**Interviewee:** vaemmlaqx


**Q:** What was your reaction to getting HR OTM? 


**A:** When i found out that I got HROTM I was so shocked! I was just cleaning my room and getting my life put together a bit when I got tons of pings just to find out I got HROTM. I was so happy and excited to get my own color and just generally have the opportunity to get this title. 


**Q:** What’s some advice you would give to LRs trying to be an HR one day? 


A: My advice is, do your best, but not too much!! I know teethyz sometimes seems like a dream, and for me it still does, but wasting all of your time on a roblox game is not good. Live your life, hang out with your friends, family, etc. 15-30 minutes a day is a good amount of activity, and even if you don’t get as much as that one day, don’t worry, just keep trying and never give up. 
Q: What’s some advice you would give to MRs or even HRs trying to open ray get MR or HR of the month? 
A: My advice for this would be basically the same as for LRs, do your best work, but don’t forget, teethyz is a roblox game and doesn’t replace your real life in any way. If you are really serious about getting HR; or MROTM then be communicative, it’s literally one of the best things to do!!

-----------------

**Interviewer:** Furnace


**Interviewee:** lehoco


**Q:** What was your reaction to getting MR OTM? 


**A:** When I got MROTM I was shocked, I had to refresh my discord because I thought I saw the wrong thing. I didn't think it would've been me, but I'm very thankful that I was chosen and recognised. 


**Q:** What’s some advice you would give to LRS trying to be an MR one day? 


**A:** Okay, overworking yourself to be a MR is not worth it, if all, you loose your motivation! If you do around 30 minutes a day, it can go a long way. Also, don't loose hope, I promise that your hard work can be paid off! 


**Q:** What’s some advice you would give to MRS trying to one day get MR OTM 
**A:** Some advice I would give is to try to keep your motivation as much as possible, however don't overwork it. It is an exciting thing that you get but don't overpower yourself for it.

**Interviewer:** angelicpayton


**Interviewee:** Frappe Public Relations


**Q)** What has working with Teethyz been like from an affiliate perspective?


**A)** Ever since initially partnering with Teethyz back in 2021, we have thorougly enjoyed working with them. Teethyz has always been a group that we've looked up to. Their Relations Team is always checking up on our group, which is truly what we admire about the group. Through the eyes of the public, it's pretty easy to make the judgement that alliances only collaborate on events here and there, but what stands out about Teethyz is the fact that they care. Behind the scenes, they are always checking up with our representatives and showing that they care. 


**Q)** What's something you've enjoyed whilst being affiliated with Teethyz? 


**A)** We enjoy how welcoming their community is! It's always a pleasure to go on alliance visits and feel so welcomed from the first second we join until the second we leave. I will say one thing, it makes us eager to come back! 


**Q)** Can you share one memorable factor of Teethyz Dentist that stands out to you? 


**A)** We recently just collaborated with Teethyz on a spring fashion show, so without a doubt that would have to be my current favorite memory. The event was extremely successful and was one of my favorites to plan. The Relations Team at Teethyz was very helpful throughout the entire event we appreciate that the owner came to participate himself! Something we don’t see from a lot of groups, so we are thankful for that!
