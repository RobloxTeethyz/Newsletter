Day of the Dead :wb_pink_flower: :m_skull: ðŸŒ¹ 

Hello, by the time youâ€™re seeing this November has concluded, however, throughout the month many special days were commemorated all around the world. One being, Day of the Dead, widely known as DÃ­a De Los Muertos. Day of the Dead is primarily celebrated all throughout Mexico and Central America. This special day is celebrated over two days, November 1st & 2nd, to reunite the dead with the living. On this day people will create offerings for their loved ones who have passed away. The purpose of the offerings is to connect the land of the dead with the living through prayers, foods, festivities, and much more. To anyone who celebrated this special day, we hope you spent it well and could reconnect with loved ones.

.ãƒ» . â‹† ðŸ¦ƒ Â» Thanksgiving

Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated by the US, Canada, etc. In the US, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the 4th Thursday of November. Friends and family would gather around the table to share a meal, celebrating life's blessings. These meals usually consist of foods such as turkey, cranberries, and pumpkin pie. Thanksgiving means the act of showing gratefulness. 

.ãƒ» . â‹† Â» History

In America, it is believed that this holiday was modelled around the Autumn feast shared by a group of pilgrims and the Wampanoag Native Americans in November of 1621. However, it wasn't until 1863 that Thanksgiving was proclaimed a national holiday.
