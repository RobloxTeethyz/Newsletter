Day of the Dead :wb_pink_flower: :m_skull: ðŸŒ¹ 

Hello, by the time youâ€™re seeing this November has concluded, however, throughout the month many special days were commemorated all around the world. One being, Day of the Dead, widely known as DÃ­a De Los Muertos. Day of the Dead is primarily celebrated all throughout Mexico and Central America. This special day is celebrated over two days, November 1st & 2nd, to reunite the dead with the living. On this day people will create offerings for their loved ones who have passed away. The purpose of the offerings is to connect the land of the dead with the living through prayers, foods, festivities, and much more. To anyone who celebrated this special day, we hope you spent it well and could reconnect with loved ones.
