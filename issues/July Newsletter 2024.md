*The 4th of July is also more commonly known as Independence Day. Americans come together and celebrate with fireworks, food, and family time. They celebrate this wonderful holiday as an acknowledgment of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Americans use this day to come together with family, and have barbeques and parades to celebrate this wonderful moment of history. We hope you enjoyed your 4th of July, let us know how it went!*


: ̗̀➛  🍁 **__Canada Day!__**


*Usually mistaken with the 4th of July, Canada Day takes place on the 1st of July. It marks the day that Canada became its own country, a symbol of independence. Canadians take time out of their day to participate in family activities and hold parades and ceremonies to celebrate this wonderful day. In Ottawa (Canada's capital city), they host unique events, such as concerts and incredible fireworks displays to show their respect. We hope you enjoyed your Canada Day! *


: ̗̀➛  🍦 **__National Ice Cream Flavour Day!__**


*Nothing beats a cold ice cream on a hot summer day, mmm! If you like ice cream, we have the perfect celebration for you! National Ice Cream Flavour Day takes place on the 1st of July. It celebrates the diversity of different ice cream flavours and explores each flavour individually. You can celebrate by making homemade ice cream, ice cream tasting parties, and maybe even trying some new flavours! It is your choice, we hope you enjoy it.*


: ̗̀➛  🤫 **__Tell the Truth day!__**


*Hm, if you like telling the truth, maybe you would want to celebrate this day! Tell the Truth Day is a day dedicated to honesty and encourages people to speak the truth in all aspects of their lives. Not only is telling the truth good, but it can also help you stay out of trouble. You can celebrate by committing to honesty, apologising and making amends or do some journaling based on your experiences. Maybe you could try some truth challenges? It is up to you, we encourage telling the truth at all times, we hope you enjoy your celebrations!*


*That's all for now, we hope you enjoyed reading about different awareness's for this month and took the time out of your day to read about them. Have a great day and see you next time!*

Mango has to be the best fruit ever, super sweet and soo refreshing, paired with ice cream, it’s always going to be a hit. Trust me, if you're in the mood for something fruity, mango does not disappoint!!

ʚ ݁ ˖ 🎂 **Answer**: My favorite ice cream flavors vary A LOT, right now at the top I’d probably put Cookie Dough and second Chocolate BUT NOT ALONE, THOSE TWO TOGETHER IS HEAVEN! Then after that needs to come Mango because that’s literally just top tier. This might cause some disagreement but probably the Blue Angel flavor, I don’t know if you know it but it’s like pink and blue, and it’s awesome. And lastly I’d do… Well, this isn’t a flavor but Water Ice, literally the best.


ʚ ݁ ˖ 🍭 **Question**: Would you recommend these flavors to others? Why?


ʚ ݁ ˖ 🌷 **Answer**: I would recommend them because they’re always something to try out, the first two are rather something milky and the last ones rather for hot summer days!

Hello, wonderful Teethyz community! This time around, I got to interview some people on a really fun topic. These people have shared silly stories from their lives. Happy reading!


𓂅 ₊˚୨୧ ★ **XxCandy2372xX**


"when I was in middle school, there’s these like classroom jobs that we had to do with another classmate of mine. FOR ME and my friend, we got a printing job. We went to this office to go print anddd the printer stopped working. So my friend decided to kick the printer so hard that it started working. Me and her were screaming at that point LMAO. THIS IS NOT RLLY THAT SILLY but it’s a silly moment."


𓂅 ₊˚୨୧ ★ ** themale_man1**


"One day, I woke up and looked out the window. To my surprise, I saw that my house was floating high up in the sky. I quickly ran to my door and opened it. I looked around and saw that I was in the middle of a sea of clouds. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I walked to the edge of the house and looked down. I was scared of heights and woke up, oh I was dreaming all the time."


𓂅 ₊˚୨୧ ★  **4RDIL**


"once in year 8 i was pulled out of one of my lessons by my head of year and he took me to his office to ask me why i walked out of my pe lesson the same day. i told him that i never walked out and was there the entire time, but he didn’t believe me and showed me an email which said that i apparently did walk out of my lesson since it had my name in the email. i was confused since that didn’t happen but my head of year didn’t believe me when i told him that it wasn’t me who walked out so he put me out of circulation (iso) for the rest of the day. turns out my pe teacher mixed my name up with another guy since we had similar names and to this day i never got an apology for that."


𓂅 ₊˚୨୧ ★ **bvubblys**


"The silliest thing that has ever happened to me was that when I was 11 I slipped on mud and fell into a giant puddle and I was covered in mud and all my friends laughed at me!"


𓂅 ₊˚୨୧ ★ **rvpwtation**


"This is a silly incident that happened in my life. So my Mom, Brother, and I were walking around at the mall and there’s this cake store that has free samples. I really wanted the cake samples but didn’t want to go in just to have the samples because that would be kind of rude and embarrassing. Anyway, my brother has lactose intolerance and I already knew that they didn’t have any cakes that were dairy free, so I had an idea. I walked in to the store and I asked if they had any dairy free cakes and they said no of course, and so I said thank you and walked around and took a sample without the cashier looking at me. I was SO proud of myself!"


𓂅 ₊˚୨୧ ★ **fwlkylee**


"its not really about me but my mom use to be friends with taylor swift and i just found out like a year ago 😭"

Greetings, Teethyz Community! This is Furnface, and welcome to the best section of the newsletter… the OTM section!!!


First we are going to start with the MR of the month! Who of which I was able to secure this interview with them.


**Furn:** What was your reaction to getting MR of the month?


**Robotsnoopy0111:** I feel honored that they thought I was worthy enough of MROTM.


**Furn:** What’s some advice you would give to LR’s trying to be an MR one day.


**Robotsnoopy0111:** Even if you feel down or like you aren't being promoted, never give up! I certainly didn't, and look where I am. It may have taken quite a lot of time, but great things take time.


**Furn:** What’s some advice you would give to MR’s trying to one day get MR of the month.

**Robotsnoopy011:** Don't over work yourself. If you ever feel like you aren't being noticed, it isn't due to the fact that you aren't working hard enough, it's just because your time hasn't came yet. Be yourself and work the normal amount. It'll be much more rewarding when you are happy and aren't over working yourself. After all, I followed what I found best, which is just being myself and not over working. Look at where I am now, I'm MROTM. If I can do it, you certainly can! C:

What nice and wise words from Spi, we congratulate her on winning MR otm! Now lets move onto our HR of the month…


**Furn:** What was your reaction to getting HR of the month?


**4RDIL:** I was shocked as I didn’t expect it at all. I’d gotten a lot of pings and DMs at the time so it was a very exciting and fun experience to have.


**Furn:** What’s some advice you would give to LR’s trying to be an HR one day.


**4RDIL:** My advice is to just to try and stand out as that plays a big part for when we decide on who to recruit for the MR team. Consistent hardwork and dedication will definitely lead to your work being acknowledged.


**Furn:** What’s some advice you would give to MR’s or even HR’s trying to one day get MR or HR of the month.


**4RDIL:** Do remember that all contributions that you make are valuable in a way. Try to get involved with different conversations/debates and just try to put your thoughts out there; no one will judge or criticize you for your thoughts. Interacting also plays a big part!

Wow! Talk about inspiring words from Ardil about his HR of the month award. Now for our last segment, our alliance of the month!!! This interview is from an alliance representative from our alliance of the month… **Pastriez**!

**leivzre:** Working with Teethyz Public Relations is an honor! Their team works extremely hard and are always willing to put in full effort into their events and our collaborations. The dedication that they have is truly inspiring, and we can't wait to host more wonderful events with them!


**Furn:** What’s your favorite part about working at Pastriez?


**leivzre:** My favorite part about working at Pastriez is hosting events and making people happy and engaged. Pastriez is very special to me as it's the community I grew up with, and being able to give back by organizing fun activities and seeing everyone enjoy them is incredibly rewarding.


**Furn:** What’s some advice you would give to people looking to get into Human Resources/ Public Relations?


**leivzre:** For anyone looking to get into Human Resources or Public Relations, my biggest piece of advice is to never give up and to always put in your best effort. Use every opportunity to grow and improve, and approach every situation with kindness and patience. Remember that great things take time, so don't be discouraged if you haven't gotten there yet. I know you can do it!
