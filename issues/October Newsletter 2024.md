![Backstory of Halloween](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efe1644e-e8bf-4b25-8f51-7497352c43c1)


▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂

Hello Teethyz! I hope you are enjoying the newsletter, because we know we are. 17thwish and carolineinthemorning are proud to present our section of the newsletter, the history of Halloween, and how the traditions originated! Halloween is celebrated all over the world, and it is important to know where this tradition started, how it did and how people celebrate it today! Without further ado, here is the newsletter!

*⤹  : How did Halloween originate?*

Halloween is widely celebrated in many places around the world, but has it ever come to mind, how did Halloween come to begin? Let’s dive into the basics. Halloween started as a tradition long ago as the ancient Celtic festival of Samhein, a religious ceremony to conclude summer and welcome fall. Many would dress up and light up the night with bonfires and torches to scare away ghosts and evil spirits. Beginning in the eighth century, Pope Gregory III made November 1st a day to remember saints. There was soon All Saints Day, and the night before called All Hallows Eve, which eventually turned into the holiday we know and love today, Halloween! It’s crazy to believe Halloween began as a celebration of the dead, however, the shoe does seem to fit!

*⤹  : How did Halloween traditions begin?*

Halloween traditions began with the Celtic festival of Samhain, marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter — a time when the Celts believed the boundary between the living and the dead was thin. On October 31, they lit large bonfires and wore costumes, often of animal skins, to ward off spirits they believed roamed the earth that night.

In the 8th century, as Christianity spread, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as All Saints' Day, blending some of Samhain’s traditions with this new holiday. The night before became known as All Hallows’ Eve, later called Halloween.

When English settlers arrived in America, they brought some of these customs with them. Halloween took on new forms as diverse colonial cultures blended, with early celebrations called "play parties" held in the fall. People would dress up, tell fortunes, and share ghost stories. Over time, Halloween grew into the celebration we know today, filled with trick-or-treating, jack-o-lanterns, costumes, and festive gatherings.

**⤹  : Interviews!**

Now, we were interested in what other people thought about this topic, so we asked a couple of MRs their thoughts on the traditions! For ourselves, we both love dressing up for Halloween. We also love how we get to get a lot of candy and eat it all! Now, for some other peoples opinions!

*︙・> Question: What are your favorite Halloween traditions?*

Interviewed: svphiees

Interviewer: 17thwish

Response: "Carving cat faces in pumpkins, trick or treating with my friends, baking Halloween deserts, and I also host charity evens relating to Halloween too!"

Interviewed: vcorria

Interviewer: carolineinthemorning

Response: "Every year I do pumpkin picking and carve them! I also do trick or treat!"

That wraps up our sections of the newsletter! I hope you enjoyed it, because we certainly enjoyed making it! If you are curious about any other part about this subject, feel free to ask us or go research it yourself! It is a very unique holiday, and it is celebrated by many across the world! We also hope you had a great month, happy Halloween!

**The Most Popular Halloween Costumes:**

Popular Halloween costumes include witches with their classic pointed hats, vampires with capes and fangs, and zombies featuring tattered clothing. superheroes like Spider-Man and Batman remain favorites, along with pirates, skeletons, and ghosts. Inflatable dinosaurs are a fun choice for kids, while fairytale characters and costumes inspired by current TV shows and movies, like "Stranger Things," also capture attention.


*ੈ✩‧₊˚ Question: What are you going to be for Halloween, and why?*


༶•┈┈┈┈୨♡୧┈┈┈┈•༶

Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz 
Interviewee: PerfectlyAnnie

For Salloween I’m going to be Brittany S. Pierce from Glee! I chose this costume because I resonate with a lot of her character traits and I’ve also been binge watching Glee a lot, so It was the first thing that came to mind.

༶•┈┈┈┈୨♡୧┈┈┈┈•༶

Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz

Interviewee: lcvelyjans 

I am going to be the Scream character, but as a girl for Halloween due to my friend group dressing up as that, we are all going to be matching! I also love the movie Scream personally which is why I’m going dressed as it too!
‌

Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz

Interviewee: 1stIovee

I am dressing up as a vampire for Halloween! I am excited to dress as this because I am matching (on roblox) with smbolz or Archaic. I am so very happy with the outcome of our outfits and I think they are SOOO cute!

༶•┈┈┈┈୨♡୧┈┈┈┈•༶

Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz

Interviewee: stargvrlavie

Just a basic costume. I'm going to be Jessy from Toy Story, and I chose that costume because me and my boyfriend are going as Jessy and Woody! Our first date was a movie night, and we watched Toy Story together. We both love Toy Story lots!

༶•┈┈┈┈୨♡୧┈┈┈┈•༶

Interviewer: flowersandrainbowzz

I’m doing a group costume with 4 of my friends! We’re dressing up like the Tally Hall band members, which is basically just black pants, a white collared shirt and a white, green, red, blue or white tie. I’m wearing the blue tie, but I’m mainly just excited to hang out with my friends.

*1﹒ Make a Halloween Playlist*

˚ʚ Why not try making a playlist with some spooky tunes? Collaborate with your friends and family to create the perfect, unique playlist of your Halloween dreams!

Some of the most popular candy include, M&M's, Reese's Cups, Sour Patch Kids, Skittles, Starburst, Hot Tamales, Candy Corn, Hershey Kisses, Hershey Mini Bars, and Butterfingers. You can even buy a cute bowl to go with it and decorate it with stickers!

*3﹒ Decorate a trunk for your local Trunk-or-Treat*

˚ʚ Does your town have a trunk-or-treat? Why not bond with your community and participate by decorating your trunk with some spider webs and pumpkins.  Pick a spooky theme to stick with and let your imagination come to real life!

*4. Decorate your house*

˚ʚ Why not decorate your front porch with some spider webs, pumpkins, and other halloween decor! You can even find some inspiration from Pinterest, or by watching house decorating videos.

*5. DIY your own Halloween costume*

˚ʚ Feeling creative? You can use old shirts, pants, and accessories to create your own unique costume! Some ideas include your favorite animal, a TV show character, or your dream occupation!

*6. Make your trick-or-treating strategy*

˚ʚ It’s not Halloween without a meticulously thought out strategy for the MOST possible candy. Get a map of your neighborhood and make the best strategy to maximize not only your candy, but also to keep your legs from getting sore.

*7. Go to a fall festival*

These are only a few ideas, but your creativity is endless and you can come up with just about anything! If that sounds like too much work, head to a local dollar store or a craft store and buy some spooky Halloween decorations!

*9. Research a Halloween costume*

˚ʚ You need to make sure that your costume is the perfect one for you. Do some research before making that big purchase! Maybe you want to be Spider-Man or a pretty sparkly princess, but you have to be sure the costume is perfect for you!

*10. Read scary stories/watch scary movies*

˚ʚ Now this one will really get you into the spirit of Halloween. Be it a scary movie at 12 AM with all of the lights off and only a bowl of popcorn beside you, or a story telling of the horrors of Halloween night accompanied by a flashlight shining eerily on your face, you’re guaranteed to be scared to your core!
