Hello Teethyz! I hope you are enjoying the newsletter, because we know we are. 17thwish and carolineinthemorning are proud to present our section of the newsletter, the history of Halloween, and how the traditions originated! Halloween is celebrated all over the world, and it is important to know where this tradition started, how it did and how people celebrate it today! Without further ado, here is the newsletter!

⤹  : How did Halloween originate?
    Halloween is widely celebrated in many places around the world, but has it ever come to mind, how did Halloween come to begin? Let’s dive into the basics. Halloween started as a tradition long ago as the ancient Celtic festival of Samhein, a religious ceremony to conclude summer and welcome fall. Many would dress up and light up the night with bonfires and torches to scare away ghosts and evil spirits. Beginning in the eighth century, Pope Gregory III made November 1st a day to remember saints. There was soon All Saints Day, and the night before called All Hallows Eve, which eventually turned into the holiday we know and love today, Halloween! It’s crazy to believe Halloween began as a celebration of the dead, however, the shoe does seem to fit!

⤹  : How did Halloween traditions begin?
    Halloween traditions began with the Celtic festival of Samhain, marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter — a time when the Celts believed the boundary between the living and the dead was thin. On October 31, they lit large bonfires and wore costumes, often of animal skins, to ward off spirits they believed roamed the earth that night.

In the 8th century, as Christianity spread, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as All Saints' Day, blending some of Samhain’s traditions with this new holiday. The night before became known as All Hallows’ Eve, later called Halloween.

When English settlers arrived in America, they brought some of these customs with them. Halloween took on new forms as diverse colonial cultures blended, with early celebrations called "play parties" held in the fall. People would dress up, tell fortunes, and share ghost stories. Over time, Halloween grew into the celebration we know today, filled with trick-or-treating, jack-o-lanterns, costumes, and festive gatherings.

⤹  : Interviews!
    Now, we were interested in what other people thought about this topic, so we asked a couple of MRs their thoughts on the traditions! For ourselves, we both love dressing up for Halloween. We also love how we get to get a lot of candy and eat it all! Now, for some other peoples opinions!
