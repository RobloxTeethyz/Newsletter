˗ˏˋ 🤍 ´ˎ˗ 🎉 ・2023 TD Milestones!・

˚ · . Hiii, how was everybody's New Years? Did you accomplish anything you wanted to in Teethyz? Well, in this section I asked a few MRs+ what their biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone was! And how they accomplished it! 
                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
                                                      Interviewer: svugarcookies
                                                       Interviewee: mayawasboard
                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
＊ ⋆ Question: What was one of your biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone you accomplished?
＊ ⋆ Answer: One of my biggest Teethyz 2023 milestones was my comeback. Coming back being a former MR was extremely hard due to the new point system which at that time required about 2k points to reach Oral Surgeon, including a bunch of trainings.

＊ ⋆ Question: How did you accomplish it?
＊ ⋆ Answer: I worked as hard as I could trying to engage with the community that had obviously changed quite a bit since I left. I started getting active setting daily goals and eventually I reached Oral Surgeon within a month. I then worked hard for a month engaging with the community, attending shifts, doing appointments, etc.. I eventually became an MI and passed and ended up being a part of the MR team once again!

                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
                                                      Interviewer: svugarcookies
                                                       Interviewee: Iowisa
                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
＊ ⋆ Question: What was one of your biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone you accomplished?
＊ ⋆ Answer: One of my biggest Teethyz 2023 milestones is that I started to become very active again every day in-game since November. In 2021-2022 I was Supervisor and now I am so happy to be back in the lovely Management Team! I have made so many new friends, laughed so much and already experienced so many wonderful memories with everyone! I passed the TSA applications in December but sadly failed the trial, then I applied again and passed in January and here I am as a Staff Assistant! I'm so proud to be back and I enjoy every day here at Teethyz! 

＊ ⋆ Question: How did you accomplish it?
＊ ⋆ Answer: How I achieved this, is not to give up. I wrote down my goals so I could work on them every day. My motivation was to look more and more forward to what I wanted to achieve! My tip is not to give up, and be yourself! Use my ideas on how I achieved this! Everyone can go far, try doing your best and you will get there!

                                                                     ‿‿‿‿

                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
＊ ⋆ Question: What was one of your biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone you accomplished?
＊ ⋆ Answer: My biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone was getting definitely getting MI!

＊ ⋆ Question: How did you accomplish it?
＊ ⋆ Answer: I accomplished it by worrying less about what rank I was or how many points I was getting and just enjoying my time playing the game!
                                                                     ‿‿‿‿

                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
＊ ⋆ Question: What was one of your biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone you accomplished?
＊ ⋆ Answer: My biggest milestone achievement in 2023 for Teethyz would be accomplishing the rank of Supervisor. I was promoted on my anniversary which marked my 4 months as a Staff Assistant. I was promoted on 18/12/23 by steveygamer2. (Ali).

＊ ⋆ Question: How did you accomplish it?
＊ ⋆ Answer: I accomplished this by making sure not to give up, even if I felt down at times. By doing this, I just kept pushing through and then all my hard work came back to me. I was, and still am, very appreciative of this moment of my career here.

📨 | **MR/HR Q&A**

Greetings Teethyz, welcome to the Q&A section of this month’s newsletter. I have asked a few questions to four of our lovely HRs and MRs. Take a look below and have fun reading! 


> (Q.) What’s your favourite childhood memory?


Interviewer: ashlvqh


Interviewee: crdigvn (MR)

(A.) My favourite childhood memory would be when I went up in the mountains and built snowmen with my parents!

Interviewer: ashlvqh


Interviewee: tcires (HR)

(A.) Some of my favourite childhood memories involve my sister because we're really close. One of my favourites is when we had to make ourselves breakfast because our parents were both busy (we were both young) and we didn't really know how so we kind of just put a lot of random things together. It tasted really bad and it was super messy but we had a lot of fun.

Interviewer: ashlvqh


Interviewee: mariesluvqs (HR)

(A.) My favourite childhood memory is picking up acorns on my front lawn with my grandma when she came to visit Canada. We would put them all in a bag and we had a huge collection of them!

Interviewer: ashlvqh


Interviewee: 24k_sxnny (MR)

(A.) My favourite childhood memory was being myself, not having to care what people thought about me; spending time with family and enjoying my childhood.

**Study Tips!**
         ⤷ By Ali (steveygamer2) and Diana (Didi_ek)

We know most of you returned from winter break earlier this month, which is why we thought it'd be a good idea to compile a list of study tips to help you improve academically! Studying can be a hassle, but these tips can help you reach your full academic potential and help you lessen stressful or overwhelming feelings that come from studying! 

📕 1 ⋆ Find a study method that works for you
There are various study methods out there; Experiment with them! Find out which ones work for you and help you study more effectively. Some methods work better for some people than others. It depends on the person and their ideal work style.

📘 2 ⋆ Study schedules and organization
Design a study schedule! This will help you stay organized and more prepared when it studying, and it can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed. 

📗 3 ⋆ To do lists
Design a to-do list, beginning with a small amount of tasks on it. As you complete them, add more until you've completed them all. This will motivate you to accomplish all of your tasks, especially if you make it a cute list! 

📙 4 ⋆ Quiz yourself
Studying isn't just re-reading your materials. Try to come up with practice questions regarding what you've learned and ask yourself them. A website that I've found to be helpful is Quizlet. It allows you to create your own study set to help you study. Feel free to check it out!

📗 5 ⋆ Ask questions
Look, we all know teachers can be intimidating at times, but they are there to help you! If you're experiencing confusion regarding what you're learning, ask your teachers to help you. If you're too nervous to raise your hand in class, write yourself a note reminding yourself to ask your questions afterward!
📘 6 ⋆ How to stay motivated
Writing pretty notes is the key. This way you will study better when you have everything nice and colorful. Buy some cute notebooks and pens too! This will keep you motivated.

📕 7 ⋆ Studying for exams
Remember that you should never study for more than 2 hours without a break. Also, don't put it off until the day before the exam. It's better to study content a few days before it and spend the day before the exam practicing to make sure you know it well. You can read it a few times at school during breaks too!

📘 8 ⋆ Quiet study place
Definitely don't study somewhere in the kitchen where your family will be walking around and distracting you. Find a quiet place and put your phone on silent. If something is still bothering you at home, you can study in libraries. It's usually quiet and you'll be able to concentrate!

📗 9 ⋆ Reward yourself
Rewarding yourself is important. After you finish studying, you can watch your favorite TV show, eat whatever you like, go to a coffee shop, spend some time with friends, etc.

📙 10 ⋆ Homework
Do your homework the day you get it assigned. That way, you won't have to stress about it for the next few days.

We hope that these will be useful to all of you who are reading this. Best of luck!

Greetings, Teethyz! We are thrilled to present the MR/HR/Alliance OTM  section for January. I've been able to have an interview with each of these individuals and groups, so please enjoy reading their answers.♡

> January's MROTM was **iiNotNia**! Her contributions to Teethyz are very appreciated, as well as her constant hard work and efforts. Here are some of her responses to the interview questions: 

Interviewer: mariesluvqs
Interviewee: iiNotNia

『1. What was your reaction after finding out you were selected for MROTM? 

A. I was really shocked and happy!!』

『2. What’s some advice you’d give to LRs trying to get MR?

A. Not to give up and keep going. Also not to over work yourself.』

『3. What’s some advice you’d give to anyone trying to get OTM?

A. Believe in yourself, help others around you and do more than you normally do.』

> Next, here is the interview with our HROTM, **iixtxshaxii**! She's extremely dedicated to the group and helps improve Teethyz in so many ways. Here are her reponses: 

Interviewer: mariesluvqs
Interviewee: iixtxshaxii

『1. What was your reaction after finding out you were selected for HROTM?

A. Wow! I was in disbelief, honestly shocked. I was so glad that I had been recognised for my hard work over this month and just unbelievably grateful.』

『2. What’s some advice you’d give to LRs trying to get MR?

A. Just keep trying. I know it’s hard sometimes but it will all be worth it. Attend shifts, recruitment and normal and just be yourself. Never change and try to push yourself infront of HRs for MR, it makes you seem needy but always be friendly!』

『3. What’s some advice you’d give to anyone trying to get OTM?

A. To be completely honest, I think staying active but not burning yourself out is the main thing. Also a main thing, I tried to balance in game and discord activeness! Not just one or the other.』

> Lastly, we were able to get an interview with one of the Public Relations officers at our alliance of the month... **Coast**! We're very grateful to be affiliated with this establishment, so here are their answers:

Interviewer: mariesluvqs
Interviewee: arvtiql

『1. What is something you enjoy about being affiliated with Teethyz?

A. Something I enjoy about being affiliated with Teethyz is that Teethyz is an amazing alliance! They have such a wonderful community with lovely staff that are always willing to help you whenever needed. Teethyz is also a very supportive alliance to us!』

『2. What's one thing about Teethyz that stands out to you the most?

A. One thing that Teethyz stands out to me the most is that Teethyz is a very unique group with the concept of it being a dentist, I don't really see dentist groups much on Roblox and Teethyz also grew a lot in these past few years making it the most popular dentist group on Roblox!』

That's all for this month's section of MR/HR/Alliance OTM! Congratulations to all of you, and thanks for reading! ♡

• Sometimes some MRs wish that they could express their opinions freely towards trollers, but they always make sure to hold back and act professionally. Our Social Assistants have therefore decided to make a Tiktok about this! Make sure to check out our page. :))
