˗ˏˋ 🤍 ´ˎ˗ 🎉 ・2023 TD Milestones!・

˚ · . Hiii, how was everybody's New Years? Did you accomplish anything you wanted to in Teethyz? Well, in this section I asked a few MRs+ what their biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone was! And how they accomplished it! 
                                                                     ‿‿‿‿

                                                       Interviewee: mayawasboard
                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
＊ ⋆ Question: What was one of your biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone you accomplished?
＊ ⋆ Answer: One of my biggest Teethyz 2023 milestones was my comeback. Coming back being a former MR was extremely hard due to the new point system which at that time required about 2k points to reach Oral Surgeon, including a bunch of trainings.

＊ ⋆ Question: How did you accomplish it?
＊ ⋆ Answer: I worked as hard as I could trying to engage with the community that had obviously changed quite a bit since I left. I started getting active setting daily goals and eventually I reached Oral Surgeon within a month. I then worked hard for a month engaging with the community, attending shifts, doing appointments, etc.. I eventually became an MI and passed and ended up being a part of the MR team once again!

                                                                     ‿‿‿‿

                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
＊ ⋆ Question: What was one of your biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone you accomplished?
＊ ⋆ Answer: One of my biggest Teethyz 2023 milestones is that I started to become very active again every day in-game since November. In 2021-2022 I was Supervisor and now I am so happy to be back in the lovely Management Team! I have made so many new friends, laughed so much and already experienced so many wonderful memories with everyone! I passed the TSA applications in December but sadly failed the trial, then I applied again and passed in January and here I am as a Staff Assistant! I'm so proud to be back and I enjoy every day here at Teethyz! 

＊ ⋆ Question: How did you accomplish it?
＊ ⋆ Answer: How I achieved this, is not to give up. I wrote down my goals so I could work on them every day. My motivation was to look more and more forward to what I wanted to achieve! My tip is not to give up, and be yourself! Use my ideas on how I achieved this! Everyone can go far, try doing your best and you will get there!

＊ ⋆ Question: What was one of your biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone you accomplished?
＊ ⋆ Answer: My biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone was getting definitely getting MI!

＊ ⋆ Question: How did you accomplish it?
＊ ⋆ Answer: I accomplished it by worrying less about what rank I was or how many points I was getting and just enjoying my time playing the game!
                                                                     ‿‿‿‿

                                                                     ‿‿‿‿
＊ ⋆ Question: What was one of your biggest Teethyz 2023 milestone you accomplished?
＊ ⋆ Answer: My biggest milestone achievement in 2023 for Teethyz would be accomplishing the rank of Supervisor. I was promoted on my anniversary which marked my 4 months as a Staff Assistant. I was promoted on 18/12/23 by steveygamer2. (Ali).

＊ ⋆ Question: How did you accomplish it?
＊ ⋆ Answer: I accomplished this by making sure not to give up, even if I felt down at times. By doing this, I just kept pushing through and then all my hard work came back to me. I was, and still am, very appreciative of this moment of my career here.

📨 | **MR/HR Q&A**

Greetings Teethyz, welcome to the Q&A section of this month’s newsletter. I have asked a few questions to four of our lovely HRs and MRs. Take a look below and have fun reading! 


> (Q.) What’s your favourite childhood memory?


Interviewer: ashlvqh
Interviewee: crdigvn (MR)

(A.) My favourite childhood memory would be when I went up in the mountains and built snowmen with my parents!

Interviewer: ashlvqh
Interviewee: tcires (HR)

(A.) Some of my favourite childhood memories involve my sister because we're really close. One of my favourites is when we had to make ourselves breakfast because our parents were both busy (we were both young) and we didn't really know how so we kind of just put a lot of random things together. It tasted really bad and it was super messy but we had a lot of fun.

Interviewer: ashlvqh
Interviewee: mariesluvqs (HR)

(A.) My favourite childhood memory is picking up acorns on my front lawn with my grandma when she came to visit Canada. We would put them all in a bag and we had a huge collection of them!

Interviewer: ashlvqh
Interviewee: 24k_sxnny (MR)

(A.) My favourite childhood memory was being myself, not having to care what people thought about me; spending time with family and enjoying my childhood.
